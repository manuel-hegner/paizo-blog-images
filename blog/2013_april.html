              <p class="date">Tuesday, April 30, 2013</p> 
              <p>Get ready for even more monsters—<a href="/products/btpy8yop"><i>Bestiary 4</i></a> is coming this Fall!</p> 
              <p>We've searched through dozens of real-world bestiaries, countless online sources, reports of strangeness from all over the world, our favorite films and fiction, and right here on our own message boards to compile another collection of creatures even more diabolical than those that have come before. Like the first three, <i>Bestiary 4</i> has more than 300 pages and features hundreds of monsters of a terrifying variety appropriate for every Pathfinder Roleplaying Game campaign.</p> 
              <p><span itemprop="description">This time there's more than just strange stories and bizarre powers amping up the threats, though. With the godlike powers soon to be unleashed in <a href="/products/btpy8x8c"><i>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Mythic Adventures</i></a>, there's about to be a whole new caliber of heroes in need of threats to overcome, and <i>Bestiary 4</i> provides. Just as characters of any level might have mythic powers, the same is true of monsters. Infused with mythic power, legends like the immortal guardian dragon, faith-fueled juggernauts, and vampiric leanen sidhe rise to rampage across your campaign. But shattering all past power levels are truly world-ending terrors like demon lords, Great Old Ones, elohim, kaiju, and more! Simply put, no Bestiary has ever been as deadly as this.</span></p> 
              <p>But even though mythic creatures function exactly as normal Pathfinder RPG monsters and are useable even in non-mythic games, they comprise but a small percentage of this collection's total terror. Inside, you'll find beasties of every Challenge Rating, of all your favorite creature types, and appropriate for adventures of every level. So what should you expect?</p> 
              <ul>
               <li>Favorites from past bestiaries, like new clockwork creatures, drakes, and gremlins!</li> 
               <li>The return of nearly forgotten foes like formians, nosferatu, and even the terrifying almiraj!</li> 
               <li>Nightmares from both the real world—like argus, einherjar, and pickled punks—and the world of Golarion—like fleshwarps, gallowdead, and psychopomps!</li> 
               <li>Terrors from your favorite fiction and film, like bodysnatchers, Grendel, and nightgaunts!</li> 
               <li>The newest generations of Bestiary regulars, like slag giants, blood golems, and the enigmatic outer dragons!</li> 
               <li>Entirely new terrors, like karkinoi, necrocrafts, owbs, and soulbound shells!</li> 
               <li>New templates like divine guardian, mummified, and shadow, to multiply your current creature collection!</li> 
               <li>New player-friendly races, familiars, and constructs offering characters a host of new options!</li> 
               <li>Mythic threats!</li> 
               <li>And much, much more!</li>
              </ul> 
              <p>Beyond giving gamers the creatures they've been begging for and expanding every GM's monstrous arsenal, each Pathfinder Bestiary has a very general theme. With <i>Bestiary 4</i>... well, just take a look at Wayne Reynolds's newest cover and take your best guess at the sorts of stories that influenced our selections.</p> 
              <p>We'll have plenty more to say about and show off from <a href="/products/btpy8yop"><i>Bestiary 4</i></a> in the months leading up to its Fall release, but for now, check out that awesome cover and start dropping menacing hints to your players—because terrible things are on the way.</p>

              <div itemprop="articleBody"> 
               <p><span itemprop="description">We move from our last international blog in Ireland to a relatively new PFS lodge in Portugal. It was one of the countries that was not currently in the PFS fold and that I had targeted last year, especially after it was announced Paizo was looking to have Pathfinder Roleplaying Game published in Portuguese. I was extrememly lucky to find the awesome and talented Raul Moura da Silva that wanted to expose Portugal to Pathfinder Society and was motivated to spread it across the entire country.</span></p> 
               <p>Without further delay, I present to you Raul’s report on Pathfinder Society in Portugal.</p> 
               <blockquote> 
                <p>Hello! I'm Raul da Silva, and I am the Venture-Captain for Portugal. I currently live in Porto. Helping me in the task of taking PFS to all corners of our country, I have two Venture-Lieutenants, Bruno Tamames in Porto, and Bruno Sequeira in Lisboa, along with a dedicated crew of nine GMs divided between both cities. We are a constantly growing group of gamers and are full of dedication.</p> 
                <p>First, I want to send a word of thanks must be given to those few, but helpful stores that help us make our community grow and thrive. These include Mundo Fantasma Porto, Kult Games Lisboa, Diver Coimbra, and our "unofficial sponsor" and regular venue, Tropical Burger Crystal Park Porto.</p> 
                <p>Next, I want to offer a few words for those of you who don't know about Portugal. Portuguese sailors were, the first true real Pathfinders of our World, at least exploration wise. They set sail for unknown lands and bravely charted the way for all that came after them in the 15th Century. The great Portuguese poet (and possibly Pathfinder Agent), Luis Vaz de Camões, wrote, "They made maps and revolutionized the way everyone sailed, and despite some errors in how they dealt with natives, brought almost all the continents together." Unfortunately, that proud and visionary past was lost through the ages, and despite still being one of the most friendly countries in the world, with wonderful people, food,weather and landscapes, is currently facing a serious financial crisis. This crisis, is also a big problem for the expansion of Pathfinder RPG in our country, both for hobby stores who are closing and/or afraid to invest in anything but card games, as well as players who lack the money to buy material.</p> 
                <p>Nevertheless, we at Portugal PFS are fighting against this!</p> 
                <p>The profile of the gaming community in Portugal, a country with a high level of education among the younger generations, the English language is almost a second natural language, with most of us speaking it or at least understanding it easily . This helps a lot when we are talking about RPG games in general, and Pathfinder in particular. Despite not having a lot of stores that sell RPG and boardgame materials, there are a few stores we are able to order from, and it's relatively cheap and fast to order online from outside of Portugal.</p> 
                <p>Traditionally there is a strong presence in our country of boardgaming players (mainly European style games), who organize big conventions across the country, and it's from this big community that most of our players comes from. We do have others joining us because due to their computer RPG games experience and knowledge. Fortunately, there is a growing and prolific RPG community across the country, playing mostly home games, but is very well informed and plays all kinds of RPG games, including Pathfinder.</p> 
                <div class="blurb180">
                 <a href="/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20130929-Lodge.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20130929-Lodge_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
                </div> 
                <p>The story behind Pathfinder Lodge Portugal all started with four players coming together in the summer of 2009 in Porto and deciding to organize a RPG gaming group to play regularly every week. We began at a local gaming store and then moved to the local "cultural gaming store", Tropical Burger. Thanks to their wise managers, it became the place where all the gaming groups in the city—boardgamers, wargamers, roleplayers and card gamers—gather almost every day of the week, at every hour of the day (the store is opened 23 hours a day, 7 days a week). I was onne of those four initial players. The others included Bruno Tamames, the local "GM Guru", who has been GMing for more than 20 years, and André Silva, one of my current GMs. We were later joined by one of the most reknown RPG enthusiast in the country, Rick "Ricardo" Danger, who helped us found Roleplayers Porto, and we began advertising our group and gaming sessions on internet sites and gaming stores. We established gaming days, events, and scheduling in conventions . This helped create similar groups in other cities, like Lisboa, where the players came together mainly at home. In the next few years, the Porto community has grown to more than 30 regular players. We have been lucky enough to have foreign players from Ireland, Scotland, Brazil, Estonia, and Russia come join us at some of our game days.</p> 
                <p>The Porto gaming groups played D&amp;D for the first years, but, there came a time in early 2012, when Bruno Tamames and I started looking for something more appealing and challenging. We found Pathfinder! We continued coordinating game days for almost a year, and then in November 2012, Mike Brock sent us an email. After some questions about our game days and events, he offered me the honor of being Venture-Captain for Portugal. I had already registered some games but knew we needed a Venture-Captain to move forward with growing Pathfinder Society. I accepted the position, and in December, started scheduling regular public events in addition to our home games. This brought players to Pathfinder RPG, and more precisely to Pathfinder Society. From that moment on, my Venture-Lieutenant and I started advertising more Pathfinder and "campaigning" for Organized Play and it's advantage. We scheduled monthly public events and smaller weekly events. We also started a <a href="http://facebook.com/PathfinderPortugal" target="_blank">Facebook group</a> to advertise our gaming sessions that we utilize for scheduling, news, and announcements. We created flyers and started distributing them throughout the city and stores and worked in making a unique graphic presentation for our group, that continues to be a constantly evolving process. I want to send a quick thanks to the designer, and local GM, Filipe Jensen.</p> 
                <p>We began our expansion across the country, first in Lisboa where we found Bruno Sequeira. He is an "old" D&amp;D player who was looking for players and helped in the founding a regular group to play. He also came onboard as a Venture-Lieutenant and has been making doing excellent work in his region. He has mentored new GMs and his hard work is paying off . We are gaining a lot of new players.</p> 
                <p>We have a loyal group of players in Aveiro and we are looking to add a Venture-Lieutenant there in the near future. We have also turned our attention to Coimbra, where Ricardo Moreno and I have started a new regular event. Currently, with only four full months of activity, we have more than 70 players registered in four cities. We have monthly and weekly events happening regularly in Porto and Lisboa, suach as the monthly PFS RPG PORTO.</p> 
                <p>Finally we look to the future. We have many ideas of what we want, and how to do it, and we have high hopes everything with come together nicely. At the top of our priorities is the increase of gaming sessions in more venues, especially in Porto and Lisboa. Next, we are trying to schedule regular monthly events in Coimbra and Aveiro, as well as a few other cities we have yet to explore, but where we know other gaming groups exist. After that, we plan to try to reach new markets, with more advertising, and some interviews in local blogs and local television stations.</p> 
                <p>Also of note is the scheduled presence of Pathfinder Society at the upcoming major national conventions (where we hope to lure Mike Brock to one day), starting with this year’s Invictacon. It will be the first, officially supported Pathfinder Society event in Portugal, and we will be making the season finales a major event, for the current season, as well every season for the foreseeable future. Lisboacon in 2014 will also feature special events and we will have registered events in two other smaller conventions. These include Riacon next month and Leiriacon in 2014.</p> 
                <p>Finally, we will continue to try and find more stores that have interest in selling physical Pathfinder RPG books to showcase the awesome things from our favorite game.</p> 
                <p>I cannot finish without thanking Mike Brock and Paizo for their continued support.</p> 
                <p>If anyone is looking for a place that has good and and inexpensive vacations, to include wonderful food, weather and landscapes, consider Portugal. But, let us know ahead of time because we'd love to have you over for a game!</p>

               <p><span itemprop="description">Greetings! I am Aslan. Cassidy (Mom) told me she introduced herself to all of you, but I was far more popular than she could ever hope to be. Considering she's one of my subjects, I think this is only fitting.</span></p> 
               <p>Mom brought me home earlier this year. All she was looking for when she walked into the pet store was a puppy fix, but per my previous brainwashing of the pet store staff, they put me in her arms instead. That she could be easily manipulated was immediately obvious. I pretended to be a loving, docile creature like all the other rabbits and ten minutes later, we were en route to my new domain.</p> 
               <p>Once we arrived, I put my master plan into action, transforming a previously unsophisticated realm into the grand kingdom of Livingroom. I used my powers of persuasion and adorably fluffy ears to secure my influence over Mom and her fiancé (Dad). I arranged for daily tribute deliveries of pellets, hay, and leafy greens. A castle was built in my honor. Cassidy's mother, who has become a powerful ally and my Grand Minion, intervened during my castle's construction to insist I be given a turret. While I was initially annoyed at her presumption, the turret has become one the most important pillars of my rule as it allows me survey my domain. Grand Minion will be spared my wrath.</p>

                <br> Chew Toy Dragon is defeated!
               </div> 
               <p>After ensuring my own kingdom's stability and training my minions to see to its day-to-day administration, I set forth to forge relations with a neighboring realm. Random, their dignitary, traveled from the far-off land of Duvall to meet with me. (Between you and me, he's the funniest-looking rabbit I've ever met.) After establishing both trade and security treaties, we cemented our bond by joining forces to purge Livingroom of its greatest threat: Chew Toy Dragon. Together, we defeated the abomination, stripping it of its teeth and forcing it to pledge its fealty to us.</p> 
               <p>Currently, I'm working on my greatest challenge yet: communicating my insatiable need for carrots and raisins to Mom and Dad. Though they seem earnest in their attempts to please me and provide me with these items on occasion, I am beginning to suspect they are taking directives from The Vet, self-appointed court dietician and my greatest enemy. Despite my suspicions, I will allow Mom and Dad to remain in my kingdom... for now. In the meantime, I will lurk in my castle, plotting new conquests and my next campaign with Random.</p> 
               <p>Until next time, loyal subjects.</p>

               <p>The <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/skullAndShackles">Skull &amp; Shackles Adventure Path</a> includes plenty of lawful evil fiends, especially in the later installments when the devil-binding nation of Cheliax enters the fray to do battle with the player characters. As such, the <a href="/products/btpy8xg6">Skull &amp; Shackles</a> set of Pathfinder Battles figures contains a nice handful of devils ready for use on your tabletop.</p>

               </div> 
               <p>Up first this week is the hated Sentinel Devil, a barbed inhabitant of the Nine Hells tasked with guarding the plane's most deadly prisoners. From time to time, wicked spellcasters summon Sentinel Devils to the Material Plane, where they make great adversaries (and effective guardians). The Sentinel Devil is a common figure.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">

               </div> 
               <p>Here we have the Greater Host Devil, first introduced in <a href="/products/btpy8a6f">Book of the Damned Volume 1: Princes of Darkness</a>. These warlike devils are tasked with retrieving souls for their infernal masters in the court of Hell, and when they venture into the Material Plane, they generally do so in large numbers. Accordingly, we've slated the Greater Host Devil in the common rarity.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130426-DrowningDevil.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130426-DrowningDevil_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>What is there to say about the Drowning Devil, first introduced in <a href="/products/btpy8tmg">Pathfinder 60: From Hell's Heart</a>, the stunning conclusion to the Skull&amp; Shackles campaign? Weighing in at 600 pounds, this CR 8 fiend freely travels the waterways of Hell, spreading infernal designs as far as Golarion and beyond. A truly stunning figure in one of the most garish paint schemes imaginable, this guy definitely calls attention to himself as a fearful foe. Just like bees and venomous snakes, you've got to watch out for the bright-colored ones. The Drowning Devil is on the Large side of Large, and he's slated at the uncommon rarity.</p> 
               <p>And with that, I've got to get back to work on our Gen Con releases before the project management devils here at Paizo pull me away into a lake of fire!</p> 
               <p>The <a href="/products/btpy8xg6">Skull &amp; Shackles</a> set of Pathfinder Battles prepainted plastic figures releases this summer. <a href="/products/btpy8o6b">Set up an ongoing subscription</a> today to make sure you don't miss a single figure!</p>

Every week from now until launch, we will be previewing parts of this book to show you what it has in store!</span></p> 
              <p><i>Ultimate Campaign</i> is divided up into four meaty chapters, each one focusing on a different part of your game. The first chapter is devoted to characters and their backstories, giving you a system for determining what happened to your character before the campaign got underway. With over 50 tables in this book, this system is designed so that you can roll randomly to determine your backstory if you prefer, based upon a number of simple character decisions, such as race and class. Alternatively, you can just pick the background that best suits your character.</p> 
              <p>The results of these tables determine what options you have in selecting your starting traits, which are greatly expanded in this chapter. In addition, some of the backgrounds might qualify you for an exciting new type of feat, the story feat. These special feats can only be taken if your character meets specific story prerequisites. While they give you a simple bonus at first, the feat itself improves if you accomplish an in-game goal. You can only have one such feat at a time, until you complete the goal of that feat, at which point you can select another one if you qualify. Take a look at this example.</p> 
              <blockquote> 
               <h2>Arisen (Story)</h2> 
               <p>Escaping death strengthened your bond to life, but fills you with a need for answers.</p> 
               <p><b>Prerequisite:</b> You must have been slain and brought back from the dead, or have the Left to Die or Cursed Birth background.<br> <b>Benefit:</b> You don’t die until your negative hit point total is equal to or greater than 4 + your Constitution score. Once per day as a standard action, you can force yourself to carry on by strength of will alone, gaining 1 temporary hit point per hit die. These temporary hit points last for 10 minutes.<br> <b>Normal:</b> You die when your negative hit point total is equal to or greater than your Constitution score.<br> <b>Goal:</b> You meet in person and hear the words of your deity or your deity’s chosen herald. If you worship a pantheon of deities, you must meet and hear a member of that pantheon—a herald does not suffice in this case. If you worship no specific deity, you must hear the words of an appropriate entity of the GM’s choice.<br> <b>Completion Benefit:</b> You gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against death effects and fear effects. In addition, the caster level of any conjuration (healing) spell that is cast on you increases by 1 for the purposes of its effects on you alone.</p>

              <h1 itemprop="headline">The Irregulars</h1> 
              <p>by Neal F. Litherland</p> 
              <h2>Chapter Four: Out with a Bang</h2> 
              <div itemprop="articleBody"> 
               <p><span itemprop="description">They moved silent as breath through the empty tunnels, tucking charges into crevices and butting them against wooden support beams. The devil's scent of saltpeter made the caverns smell like Hell, ready to burn with a single, ragged spark. Fairy lights danced in the deeper darkness where the Lieutenant and Trilaina licked wicks and set fuses, making certain everything was perfect. Up near the ore doors, Garm and Chaplain laid their casks with held breath. They were so close they could smell the sweat of the Molthuni regulars on the other side of the barred doors.</span></p> 
               <p>The cleric tapped Garm on the shoulder and pointed to the columns that framed the entrance. Garm set the keg down like it was made of glass, gently turning it back and forth to set it in the dirt. He was repeating the process with the other side of the door when something caught his ear. He cut his hand through the air and crept closer, pressing a tattered ear to the central crevice.</p> 
               <p>"You heard from either of them, though?" A man's voice. "They haven't come up in hours."</p> 
               <p>"Probably off with that girl Goblin's always talking about," another voice answered. The second voice was deeper, harder, with something inhuman in its accent and ancestry. "He won't shut up about her. If'n she wasn't a slave, I think he'd try and marry her."</p> 
               <p>"If she wasn't a slave, Goblin would have been clapped in irons by now," the first voice answered.</p> 
               <p>"Truth," the gruff voice answered. The first said something else, but Garm couldn't make it out. When the conversation picked up again, the words were more intelligible, and they sent a chill down Garm's spine.</p> 
               <p>"Still, it's strange that they haven't even checked in." Leather creaked and chain rustled as the other guard shifted his feet. "Maybe we should go and take a look?"</p> 
               <p>"I see enough of those two as it is."</p> 
               <p>"Maybe it's time for them to take a turn up here." The first voice stifled a yawn. "Got to change posts, make sure everyone stays sharp. I'd rather be down there than up here."</p> 
               <p>"You go check, I'll keep eyes up here," the other guard said. "You've got fifteen minutes. After that, you're not my problem."</p> 
               <p>Garm jerked his head at Chaplain. They grabbed the last three casks, using the noise of the door as cover while they sped around a corner. Chains tightened, and the bar lifted out of its brackets with a groan. One door creaked, and weak lamplight slipped into the underground. The door shut with a hollow boom. Chains rattled, and the beam dropped back into place.</p> 
               <p>"Your loss," the first guard called back through the door. Garm and Chaplain flattened themselves against the wall as the man approached the turn, but he stopped and turned back the way he'd come. His spear clattered against the wall, and a moment later the rain gutter sound of an emptying bladder filled the cavern. They heard him kick dirt over the puddle, then the lantern creaked as he lifted it up. "What the hell?"</p> 
               <p>Garm's soles made no noise on the smooth stone as he slipped behind the man and wrapped an arm around his neck. The half-orc wrenched, and the guard's neck snapped like a dry-rotted twig. The rank smell of excrement filled Garm's nostrils, and he dragged the corpse as quietly as he could. He looked at Chaplain, who made the sign of the hammer over the dead man.</p> 
               <p>"I think we're out of time," Garm whispered.</p> 
               <p>"Agreed."</p> 
               <p>Chaplain grabbed the lantern, and Garm tore the lids off the remaining casks. Black powder glinted in the lantern light—sand with the breath of a volcano buried inside. Chaplain started down the hall, and Garm followed a moment later, leaving a trail of powder to the others kegs they'd already placed. Chaplain started humming an old dwarven tune the rest of the Irregulars would recognize, just in case someone got jumpy and started shooting at anyone carrying a lantern.</p>

                <br> The Lieutenant is a little crazy, but all good officers are.
               </div> 
               <p>"What went wrong?" The Lieutenant stepped out from behind a pillar.</p> 
               <p>"Guard got curious." Garm poured out the remainder of the last cask. "His partner gave him fifteen minutes before he had to be back, and half of that's already gone."</p> 
               <p>The Lieutenant nodded. "All right, then. I'll slap the trigger together and hope for the best." He reached into a side pocket of the bag and pulled out three stoppered clay flasks. Fragile at the best of times, they'd do well enough for a timer. The Lieutenant laid the alchemical fire-flasks flat on their sides, and uncorked one more bottle. He leaned it carefully, the thick slosh of the caustic contents enough to give anyone pause. </p> 
               <p>Somewhere above them, an alarm bell brayed its single, brassy note. </p> 
               <p>The Lieutenant glared at the ceiling, then at the others. "Well? What are you waiting for, a bloody invitation? Get the hell out of here!"</p> 
               <p>They ran, but even the hard pounding of their footsteps and the muted call to arms overhead couldn't block out the pop of the cork, and the steady drip-sizzle of acid as it poured out onto the clay. They sped past supports and stress fractures, packed and fused, everything ready to blow at the first breath of flame. Garm slammed his shoulder into the exit door, sending it squealing open on its hinges. Trilaina leaped over the threshold, hair flying in a fan behind her and color riding high in her cheeks. Chaplain burst out last, boots dragging into the dirt as she tried to slow her forward momentum. </p> 
               <p>Gunner emerged from his post behind a nearby stone, Denna at his side. "What happened?"</p> 
               <p>"Lieutenant had to improvise the detonator," Trilaina panted.</p> 
               <p>The gnome's eyes shot wide. He swung into the saddle and put his heels to the she-wolf's ribs. Mount and rider took off like they'd been fired from a siege engine, vanishing down into the obscured path along the ridge.</p> 
               <p>"You'd think he would have waited," Trilaina said.</p> 
               <p>"Did you forget what happened last time we tried this maneuver?" Garm asked. </p> 
               <p>Before the half-elf could reply, the Lieutenant burst from the tunnel entrance, his bad leg making him lope like a retired race horse.</p> 
               <p>"I would suggest we run now," the Lieutenant said. He emptied a flask down his throat, the contents syrupy slick and reeking of corrupt sugar and fermented poison. His lips drew back, and a shudder went through him as everything in the old man cranked a notch tighter. Joints popped, tendons sprung to attention, and his skin creaked like leather as the formula took hold. "Race you!"</p> 
               <p>They ran, hell hounds that had slipped their leashes and had no intention of ever going back. They skidded and tumbled, leaping over rocks and dodging over smooth patches that cut corners around switchbacks. One step ahead of a broken neck, they made it to the gentler foothills and ducked behind an outcropping. Before they could draw more than a single breath, the fuse hit home.</p> 
               <p>It started small. A rumble shook the earth, like the snore of an ancient colossus rolling over in its sleep. Stones that had sat in the same place for centuries jumped and bounced, falling over one another in their hurry to escape the fury boiling inside the mine. Everything went silent. After a few more breaths, the squad peered out to look at their handiwork. </p> 
               <p>The mountain exploded.</p> 
               <p>The hidden door splintered as fire and flame belched from the stone throat. A choking cloud of dust followed, tinged red by iron dust. The valley shook, and a roar like a beast in agony echoed across the crags. The surrounding hills gave back the cry, turning it into a chorus of rage and pain. Then, like a child calmed after a nightmare, everything fell silent again. </p> 
               <p>The squad looked to the Lieutenant. He shrugged. "Let's circle back around, make sure all the slaves got clear and that we really did what we came here to do."</p> 
               <p>They took formation, and looped a wide circle back to the front of the mine. They obliterated tracks where they found them, and kept to the rocky areas where they could. They tried to stay low, crawling through ditches or ducking into dry ravines where they could move quickly without the risk of anyone seeing them. </p> 
               <p>Gunner was the first to break the silence. "Guys," he said, peering over the lip of a sheltered ridge. "Get up here. You're going to want to see this."</p> 
               <p>One by one, they crept over the natural wall to see what they'd done. </p> 
               <p>The mountain was the same, reared up squat and wide against the sky. The road up to the mine was still there, as was most of the geography they'd spent all of yesterday studying so thoroughly. But the mine itself was completely unrecognizable. All that was left was a depression filled with crumbled rock and the remains of a few structures that had fallen down into the hole when their supports collapsed. One defensive wall had been shaken out like loose teeth, and the other clung on, nearly pristine despite the destruction that had reshaped the landscape in a moment. Nothing moved down among the destruction, except the odd tongue of fire that licked across smashed beams or broken doors.</p> 
               <p>"I told you it was poorly built," Chaplain said. </p> 
               <p>The others grinned, and at a hand signal from the Lieutenant dipped back down out of sight. They hunkered close together, eyes combing fore and rear to make sure no unexpected outliers took them by surprise again.</p> 
               <p>"Everyone, listen up," the Lieutenant said. "We did good work. But this is just the tip of the iceberg."</p> 
               <p>He smoothed the settled dust and laid out the countryside all around him and his squad. Mountains to the east, flat countryside broken by cities and rivers to the west. With precise measurements he drew three more X's along the mountains.</p> 
               <p>"We've made a good start, but a few escaped slaves and a single collapsed ore pit aren't going to slow down the war machine that Markwin Teldas and his ilk have built in this little place," the Lieutenant said. "The plan right now is to stay one step ahead of the reinforcements that will be combing the mountains, and make sure we have a few encore performances before we head back home to Andoran, where I'm sure we'll be welcomed with open arms and enough medals to tear your tunics."</p> 
               <p>The Lieutenant put his right hand out over the map. The others did the same, gripping tight to each other. The Lieutenant smiled, and his troops returned it. </p> 
               <p>They were the best of the best of the bottom of the barrel. The bloody hands that broke locks and necks with equal aplomb. They had their mission, and nothing would stand in their way. Gods above and below help the poor fools who chose to try.</p> 
               <p>"Gunner, take point," the Lieutenant said. "If Trevon is to be believed, then we're going to have company very soon, and I doubt they'll be as thrilled with our night's work as we are." He rose stiffly to his feet. "All right, Irregulars, let's move out."</p>

                </div> 
                <p>Ragathiel, child of the archdevil Dispater and a goddess of fire, stands on the front line of the war between Heaven and Hell. He carves through legions of fiends and drives back lesser evils with the mere presence of his awful majesty.</p> 
                <p>Ragathiel is a tower of glorious might. He stands almost 20 feet tall, and five lofty burning wings stretch from his back. The General of Vengeance once had six wings, but one was severed, torn from his body by Dispater himself.</p> 
                <p>Ragathiel's tainted heritage has left him with a wrathful heart, and the angel struggles constantly to master his baser impulses in service to the light. For thousands of years he strove to prove himself to the angelic choirs of Heaven. In the Maelstrom he wrestled for 16 years with a monstrous evil serpent whose scales wept acidic blood until he was able to choke the life out of it. He led an entire army against one of the iron fortresses of Avernus and burned the castle to the ground with holy fire, single-handedly maiming Infernal Duke Deumus in the process. Finally the other empyreal lords agreed to admit Ragathiel into their ranks, and now they appear to trust the angel completely—though that trust took centuries to develop.</p> 
                <p>Ragathiel takes an active role in the battle against Hell's fiendish legions. He shines at the head of his army, a figure of golden light cleaving through the ranks of devils that face him. Soldiers of all kinds, but particularly knights, pay homage to Ragathiel and pray for his virtue and wrathful strength in battle. Those who have taken vows, especially those of duty or vengeance, hold Ragathiel as their ideal, and his agents sometimes assist those who have been grievously wronged and now seek righteous vengeance.</p> 
                <p>The lower slopes of Heaven are home to Ragathiel's Fortress, a magnificent steel structure designed to withstand a thousand-year siege if need be.</p>

              <div itemprop="articleBody"> 
               <p><span itemprop="description">This week we interrupt our usual schedule of previews for the upcoming <a href="/products/btpy8xg6">Skull &amp; Shackles</a> set of <a href="/store/byCompany/w/wizKids/byProductType/pathfinderMiniatures">Pathfinder Battles</a> prepainted fantasy miniatures to bring you an update on exciting Pathfinder Battles developments related to other product releases.</span></p> 
               <p>Ever since our second set, <a href="/products/btpy8rqs">Rise of the Runelords</a>, we've been working with WizKids to find a better solution for releasing Huge miniatures into the Pathfinder Battles line. Releasing figures this large as part of a normal set previously involved two different kinds of booster boxes, which was confusing to both customers and retailers. We knew we needed a better solution.</p> 
               <p>Today we're announcing a release that we believe is a step toward a better solution for Huges in the form of a new Encounter Pack entitled <a href="/products/btpy8yj4">White Dragon Evolution</a>. This new non-random boxed set is scheduled for a summer release, and will include THREE original white dragon sculpts!</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130419-MediumFront.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130419-MediumFront_180.jpeg" border="0"></a> <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130419-MediumBack.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130419-MediumBack_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Up first we have the Medium White Dragon, perfect for a low-level end boss or mid-level minion. Based on art created for the <a href="/products/btpy8tj5">Pathfinder Bestiary Box</a> by Paizo favorite (and <a href="/paizocon">PaizoCon 2013</a> Special Guest) Ben Wootten! This Medium White Dragon may seem small compared to his larger brothers in the White Dragon Evolution set, but I assure you he's so awesome it'll freeze your blood.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130419-LargeFront.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130419-LargeFront_180.jpeg" border="0"></a> <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130419-LargeBack.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130419-LargeBack_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Here we have the next step in a dragon's life cycle, the Large White Dragon! This all-new sculpt is also based on a Ben Wootten illustration, and it really pushes the upper end of the Large scale, giving you more mini for your money.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130419-HugeFront.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130419-HugeFront_180.jpeg" border="0"></a> <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130419-HugeBack.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130419-HugeBack_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>This friendly fellow was originally sculpted for inclusion in the Rise of the Runelords set, and is based on Wayne Reynolds's cover illustration for <a href="/products/btpy815p">Pathfinder Adventure Path #5: Sins of the Saviors</a>. We're thrilled to finally bring this Huge figure to you, and I can't wait to see what you think when you have it in hand. I think it's one of the best sculpts we've done to date.</p> 
               <p>More "Evolution" Encounter Packs will be announced in the next few months, showing additional creatures at multiple sizes. We also plan to release additional Huge figures in the Encounter Pack boxed set format based around themes rather than a single creature presented three different ways. Stay tuned to this space for more news as it develops.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">

               </div> 
               <p>Several weeks ago I mentioned that we forgot to photograph two figures from June's <a href="/products/btpy8ww8">We Be Goblins!</a> Builder Series set. Well, the production samples for this set arrived at the Paizo offices this week, so they're finally ready for their big debut. This guy above, the Goblin Commando on Goblin Dog, is ready to tear into your campaign (and into your player characters).</p>

               </div> 
               <p>And last we have the lowly Goblin Dog, a verminous pet kept by goblins in lieu of actual dogs, whom goblins hate with unparalleled passion. Both of these figures are at the common rarity.</p> 
               <p>And that's it for this week! Join us here next week as we once again set sail into the dangerous waters of the <a href="/products/btpy8xg6">Skull &amp; Shackles</a> set!</p>

              <div itemprop="articleBody"> 
               <p><span itemprop="description">There are some big changes in store for the Pathfinder Society Organized Play campaign, beginning in <a href="/pathfinderSociety/pfsproducts/scenarios/season5">Season 5—the Year of the Demon</a>.

               <h2>Campaign Announcements</h2> 
               <p>Below are a few of the changes we wanted to bring to light that are coming down the pipe in the next few months, culminating at Gen Con in August.</p> 
               <ul>
                <li>We are removing two factions from the campaign as character choices. The first to be phased out will be the Lantern Lodge faction. When <a href="/products/btpy8we1"><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #4-21: Way of the Kirin</i></a> is released in late May, members of the faction will get to participate first-hand in the culmination of their faction's plot. At PaizoCon in early July, <a href="/products/btpy8we3"><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #4-23: Rivalry's End</i></a> will similarly conclude the Shadow Lodge faction's involvement at a PC organization in the campaign. Members of each retiring faction will receive a special boon in their respective retirement scenario exclusive only to members of the affiliated faction.<br><br> Members of eliminated factions will be able to join one of the eight remaining factions at no cost of Prestige Points, and must do so by August 14, 2013. Characters will be able to keep faction-specific traits, boons, vanities, and prestige awards received while members of the Lantern Lodge and Shadow Lodge, with one exception. The "no one left behind" prestige award found in the Pathfinder Society Field Guide will no longer be available for play.<br><br></li> 
                <li>There will be a fundamental change in how faction missions work in scenarios. The biggest change is that individual scenarios will no longer provide faction mission handouts except in rare circumstances. Scenarios will be written with the Pathfinder Society's goals in mind first and foremost, and many will also involve the specific interests of one or more, much like <a href="/products/btpy8v0h"><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #4-11: The Disappeared</i></a> and <a href="/products/btpy8v0j"><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #4-13: Fortress of the Nail</i></a> involved the entire society working toward a goal that had special significance to members of the Cheliax faction. Choices and successes will matter and we are instituting additional reporting conditions that will allow us to help the player base shape not only the future direction of the campaign, but also the fundamental beliefs and directions of their own factions.<br><br></li> 
                <li>We are reviewing a change in wealth earned in scenarios, specifically regarding characters playing outside their designated subtier. We have several ideas in mind and are requesting feedback from the player base to find the best solution to the problem. We encourage anyone interested in participating in this process to visit the paizo.com messageboards to add your input to the discussion.<br><br></li> 
                <li>We want to ensure the community is aware that we will continue to sanction past Pathfinder Adventure Paths over the coming months. The next to be released for sanctioned play will be the <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/skullAndShackles">Skulls &amp; Shackles Adventure Path</a>, and the current plan is to continue working backward in order of release until all APs released under the Pathfinder RPG rules are legal for Pathfinder Society credit. In addition, we will continue to sanction future releases of APs when we can and when it makes sense for the campaign. We are currently reviewing the <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/wrathOfTheRighteous">Wrath of the Righteous Adventure Path</a> to see if it is possible to sanction an adventure path that relies heavily on the use of the new <a href="/products/btpy8x8c">Mythic rules</a> scheduled to release at Gen Con.<br><br></li> 
                <li>Finally, we are revamping the format of the Chronicle sheets awarded for reading novels in our Pathfinder Tales fiction line. Instead of providing a distinct Chronicle sheet for each individual novel, we will begin releasing Chronicle sheets that cover four novels. Each new Chronicle sheet will release with the first novel of a four-book series, and contain information on the three novels that will be released later in the year. Each novel with have a boon or unique item tied specifically to the flavor or location of that novel. A player who brings a copy of a novel to a Pathfinder Society game along with the associated Chronicle sheet gains access to the novel's boon, and can apply that boon to any of her characters. When a GM has initialed all four novels on a single Chronicle sheet, the player can select one of the four boon as a permament or reusable boon which she can assign assign to one of her characters.</li>
               </ul> 
               <p>The first of these new-format Chronicle sheets will cover <a href="/products/btpy8x1j"><i>Liar's Blade</i></a>, <a href="/products/btpy8xc7"><i>Pirate's Honor</i></a>, <a href="/products/btpy8wbz"><i>Wizard's Mask</i></a>, and <a href="/products/btpy8x8j"><i>King of Chaos</i></a>, and should be available in the next few weeks. We'll release a new Chronicle sheet shortly after Gen Con to cover the next batch of four novels coming out later in 2013 and early 2014.</p> 
               <h2>Gen Con Volunteer Update</h2> 
               <p>Speaking of Gen Con, I still have a few volunteer positions left to fill. I have a small number of tables remaining that need Pathfinder Society GMs, including one Tier 1 GM spot left to fill. So, if you need free crash space at a hotel, a free 4-day badge, paizo.com store credit, four free GM-exclusive goblin t-shirts, a copy of the <a href="/products/btpy8x8c"><i>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Mythic Adventures</i> hardcover</a>, and a special GM boon that alternatively opens the grippli as a legal character race or grants you a one-time complete character rebuild, please email me. This spot is likely to go fast!</p> 
               <p>Additionally, I have just been allocated two additional hotel rooms at the Omni for volunteers interested in running <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame"><i>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</i></a> demos in the Paizo booth during exhibit hall hours. If you are looking for a share of a free hotel room, a free 4-day badge, as well as paizo.com store credit, your choice of a copy of the Mythic Adventures hardcover or the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, and four purple volunteer goblin shirts, please email me at <a href="mailto:mike.brock@paizo.com?subject=Gen Con Volunteer">mike.brock@paizo.com</a>. I have enough room for eight such volunteers for the <i>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</i>.</p> 
               <p>As always, we look forward to trying to create the best organized play experience we can for all of you. Please head over to the <a href="/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/pathfinder/pathfinderSociety">Pathfinder Society messageboards</a> and let us know what you think. Thanks again for being the best fan base any gaming company could ask for.</p>

               <p>I graduated from the University of Washington with a degree in International Studies, dreaming that I would one day become a diplomat. However, it was gently pointed out to me that I do not have the temperament for diplomacy. Since I usually play gold draconic bloodline sorceresses and love nothing more than casting indiscriminate fireballs, I was forced to agree.</p> 
               <p>Previously, I've worked as a horseback riding teacher, stagehand, carnie, barista, and, mostly recently, a college admissions official. After growing weary of crushing the dreams of starry-eyed high school students for a living, I did some soul-searching and decided to pursue my true passion: writing. The folks at Paizo have kindly taken me in to teach me the publishing business and I couldn't be more excited.</p> 
               <p>In my spare time, I enjoy archery, lock picking, futilely attempting to train my lion-headed bunny Aslan, and- of course- gaming. My fiancé and I currently play in two Pathfinder campaigns and are maxing out our Borderlands II characters.</p>

              <p>by Neal F. Litherland</p> 
              <h2>Chapter Three: In the Black</h2> 
              <div itemprop="articleBody"> 
               <p>"Are you sure it's here?" Trilaina whispered. </p> 
               <p>Chaplain nodded, thick brown braid bobbing. "See there and there, the stress fracture lines they tried to hide? And how the stone around it is worn smooth, but this one spot is chiseled? It's been here a while, but it still doesn't fit here."</p> 
               <p>"Dwarves know their rocks," Gunner said as he watched their back trail. As far as his eyes were concerned, it was still as bright as daylight, even with a sky empty of anything except stars.</p> 
               <p>"My father was a stonemason," Chaplain said, putting a glare into her voice. Gunner made a small gesture over his shoulder, a duelist conceding a point to an opponent. Trilaina shrugged and ran her hands over the rock, eyes narrowed as if she could see through the stone.</p> 
               <p>"Even if it is a door—and I'll take your word that it is—there would have to be a knob, or a trigger or something..." Trilaina trailed off and smiled. Her fingers disappeared into a hidden niche, and something clicked softly. "Looks like I found our way in."</p> 
               <p>"’Bout time," the Lieutenant mumbled. "I'm tired of standing out here in the dark."</p> 
               <p>"Details, details," the half-elf murmured. "Everybody ready?"</p> 
               <p>Tendons creaked and knuckles popped. Cold steel whispered out of sheaths and glimmered beneath the moonless sky as the team nodded their assent. Trilaina filled her free hand with a nasty little hawkbill blade and opened the door. Counterweights turned, pulleys groaned, and the hundred-stone weight swung wide.</p> 
               <p><span itemprop="description">The assault was precision-perfect, and quiet as a greased whisper. They charged into the blackness, teeth bared, ready to bring permanent silence to the dark places beneath the mountain. Instead they found an empty hallway, the door flanked by dark lanterns and lonely-looking chairs. A deck of cards sat on a scarred tabletop, dog-eared and forlorn. The air tasted stagnant, and cold as second-day stew. They lowered their weapons, and Chaplain pulled the door closed.</span></p> 
               <p>"Where is everyone?" Trilaina asked.</p> 
               <p>"They're watching the woods for bogeymen," Hook said. He popped a match and lit a lantern. "They're down a patrol, with one man still missing in action, and everyone up there is wondering where we are. Just as I figured. The way out is a secret, and it's one of about a hundred possible approaches. In the dark, most people wouldn't have a shot in hell of finding it."</p> 
               <p>"Where do we go from here?" Garm asked.</p> 
               <p>"You and Chaplain reconnoiter," the Lieutenant said, slinging a leather bag down off his back and reaching in to the shoulder. "Eliminate threats if necessary, but bring your mental maps back here. After that, we move on to stage two."</p> 
               <p>The soldiers nodded, and the darkness swallowed them. Trilaina and Lieutenant Hook donned stolen armor stained with blood and took seats at the table. Trilaina dealt a hand of a game called king is dead. Gunner leaned on the wall and watched the shadows. Denna lay down with her nose on her front paws. She took deep breaths and awaited the approach of strangers. Seconds turned to minutes like slow-burn alchemy, but none of them moved. They knew their work, and waiting was part of it.</p> 
               <p>On the third hand, with Trilaina dealing bottom deck, footsteps approached. They heard the soft whisper of bare flesh on the stony floor flanked by two sets of boots. Hands wrapped around hilts, and eyes turned to the shadows. A girl with close-cropped hair, strong shoulders, and a shapeless shift wrapped around her body walked out of the darkness, Garm and Chaplain on either side.</p> 
               <p>"Taking in strays now, are we?" Trilaina asked. Garm held up his right hand. The knuckles gleamed with fresh, red blood.</p> 
               <p>"There were supposed to be two guards at this post," he said. "They decided no one would come in this door, so they went off to have a bit of fun."</p> 
               <p>"Is that what they're calling it these days?" Chaplain's frown pulled her entire face taut, and her dark eyes simmered. Garm nodded grimly.</p> 
               <p>"I hope you didn't show them your gentle side," Trilaina said. Garm shook his head. </p> 
               <div class="blurb360">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Chaplain.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Chaplain_360.jpeg" border="0"></a>
                <br> Chaplain is as good with people as she is with her hammer.
               </div> 
               <p>Chaplain gently touched the girl's arm. "Go on, Rulla. Tell the Lieutenant what you told us."</p> 
               <p>The girl stared at them, hard eyes still suspicious. She swallowed and looked back where she'd come from. Apparently she considered them the lesser of two evils.</p> 
               <p>"The guards put us all in our cells hours ago," she said. "They took every digger out of the hole and filled every bolt room. Except for Regan and Goblin, everyone else is up on the wall."</p> 
               <p>"Goblin?" Gunner raised an eyebrow.</p> 
               <p>"Ugly whoreson," Garm replied. "My guess is his parents probably saw one and decided it was a fitting name."</p> 
               <p>"Go on, Rulla, tell him the rest." Chaplain silenced her squadmates with a look. Rulla licked her lips.</p> 
               <p>"When the last guards went up, they barred the ore gate," she said. "There's no way in or out except the rear door unless that main gate is opened."</p> 
               <p>The Irregulars looked at each other for several long moments, letting the significance sink in. The Lieutenant smiled, and his troops smiled back. He stripped off the stained leather and tossed it aside. Trilaina slit the lacing and peeled her disguise off like an unwanted second skin. Garm lit the second lantern and handed it to the half-elf.</p> 
               <p>"New plan, everyone." The Lieutenant rubbed his hands together. "Gunner, get outside and watch the hilltop. If someone realizes the mountain's bleeding out the rear passage, they're going to stopper us up from both ends."</p> 
               <p>"Consider it done." Gunner mounted up, and Garm opened the door far enough for the duo to slip back into the dim night. He closed it without letting the door catch.</p> 
               <p>"Garm, did you get the keys from the guards?" Both the half-orc and the dwarf took out two sets of well-used iron keys. The Lieutenant nodded approvingly. "Rulla, is everyone down here a slave?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, sir." Her eyebrows drew together. She looked unsure, but she also clearly knew it was too late to stop, even if she wanted to.</p> 
               <p>"Good. Are there any hard cases we need to know about?" </p> 
               <p>Rulla shrugged. "I suppose." </p> 
               <p>Hook nodded, stroking his chin. "Anyone that belongs in this hole?" </p> 
               <p>Rulla narrowed her eyes. "You're just trusting me? Just like that?"</p> 
               <p>"He does that," Garm said, looking back into the darkness.</p> 
               <p>"And you'd just leave them in those cages?"</p> 
               <p>"Probably not," the Lieutenant admitted. "But I might make sure they went last, after everyone else got a head start. That would make them the most likely to be caught, and it would give everyone else more time to get away."</p> 
               <p>"No," Rulla said. The Lieutenant raised one bushy eyebrow. "No, there's no one that I think will make trouble. No one wants to be here, and if they were given a choice, they'd run till their feet bled."</p> 
               <p>"Hopefully it won't come to that," Chaplain said.</p> 
               <p>"There's only two keys, but we have to be fast." The Lieutenant sucked his teeth, glaring at the imaginary clock in his head. "Garm, you and Chaplain unlock the cages and send people back to this room. We'll make this our jump-off point. Small groups, easily mobile. Look for night-sights and moonbeams, spread 'em around as necessary so we don't have a bunch of scared people stumbling around in the dark and making all kinds of noise. We can't give them lights, much as we might like to. They're a high priority, but not number one."</p> 
               <p>"What are you going to do?" Trilaina asked. </p> 
               <p>The Lieutenant pointedly sat down in the chair he'd vacated a moment ago. "I’m going to supervise. From here, I can bottleneck either way, and keep a leash on this whole thing."</p> 
               <p>Garm, Trilaina, and Chaplain nodded, then scattered. Silence rolled in like an ebb tide. </p> 
               <p>Rulla looked at the Lieutenant, who took out a long-stemmed pipe. At last, she could stand it no more. </p> 
               <p>"Why are you doing this?" she asked.</p> 
               <p>The Lieutenant slowly crossed his good leg over his bad one, then lit the pipe and puffed. "Why are you here, Rulla?"</p> 
               <p>"I was sold to a slaver by my husband to pay gambling debts to a bookie in Laekastel." Her tone was flat, yet the Lieutenant could still hear coals burning beneath the ashes.</p> 
               <p>"Cheliax." The Lieutenant turned the nation's name into a curse. "Molthune is a small man with big plans. It has everything it needs to become an empire: ore, timber, fertile soil, and a defensible border to keep it safe from invasion. But you can't fight wars without soldiers, and you can't reap or sow without farmers. It’ll take too long to do it the old-fashioned way. The saber rattlers want to be kings now. So they buy slaves."</p> 
               <p>Rulla nodded. The Lieutenant blew a smoke ring, then cocked his head and listened. He stood, holding the lantern high.</p> 
               <p>They appeared like bog ghosts—filthy, pale will-o’-wisps with wide eyes and bent backs. Most were human, but an occasional dwarf or half-breed stood out among them. Down in the darkness, they'd all become one, and it was as one they came to escape. The Lieutenant looked at them and grinned, tapping out his pipe as he blew the remnants through his nose like a dragon scenting prey. He glanced at Chaplain and jerked his head. </p> 
               <p>The dwarf stood up on the rickety chair, facing the room. The assembled slaves stared at her with red-rimmed eyes.</p> 
               <p>"Prisoners of Molthune, listen close." Chaplain was never loud, but when she spoke people listened. A murmur went through them, and they shuffled forward to hear her. "You have been bought and sold. You have been brought to this place and turned into little more than cattle that can swing a pick and carry stones. Today that life is over. Today we’re giving you back the freedom that never should have been taken from you."</p> 
               <p>A soft, furtive cheer went up, as ragged and dirty as the men and women that offered it. Chaplain held her arms out, quieting and embracing them all as she continued.</p> 
               <p>"The night is long and the mountains are treacherous. You need to move quickly and quietly. You’ll have to help each other get away. Eagerness will get everyone caught, so listen carefully and do as you're told."</p> 
               <p>Trilaina and Garm took charge, dividing the escapees into small groups. They went quickly, quietly, slinking out of the mountain as Gunner led them to safety. One group left, another got ready, and soon the numbers dwindled to nothing.</p> 
               <p>"Good speech," the Lieutenant said.</p> 
               <p>"Thank you sir," Chaplain replied.</p> 
               <p>The Lieutenant flipped the flap on his bag of tricks and dug down deep. He pulled out a wooden cask, stoppered with cork and smelling strongly of sulfur. Then another, and another, stacking them nearby. He eyed every member of the team, lips peeling back in a wolfish grin.</p> 
               <p>"Now comes the fun part."</p>

               <p>I began playing RPGs in the late '90s in the wake of Pokémon leaving the Magic and L5R worlds starved for players. I learned to play at my local game store and have been pursuing the hobby ever since. I started with 3rd Edition and then 3.5, before branching out into other game systems. My fiancé first introduced me to Pathfinder during the open beta test for the Advanced Players Guide.</p> 
               <p>In the summer of 2011 we moved to Redmond, WA so my fiancé could work towards his Masters degree. Shortly after our move I began playing Pathfinder Society, then GMing Pathfinder Society, then coordinating Pathfinder Society, and before I knew it I had picked up running Pathfinder Society four nights a week! I became the Venture Lieutenant for the Seattle area in September 2012 under Venture Captain Kyle Elliot.</p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p>No one enjoys paying taxes. Every year, though, on the 15th of Gozran, priests of the church of Abadar spend the day walking city streets, doing what they can to make the bitter pill of annual taxes a bit easier to swallow. From dawn to dusk, clerics of Abadar attend the tax collectors of sizable communities as the tax wagons roll from door to door. More than just aiding in the yearly errand, the faithful personally thank every citizen for contributing to the improvement of their city, extol the public works funded by their contributions, and foretell the grandeur of civic projects to come. The disenfranchised and destitute they attempt to comfort as best they can, quoting from their god's dogma on work and worthiness, but this is not a day for discounts or deferrals.</p> 
                <p>At dusk, the Abadarans host several celebrations in parks, plazas, and other communal areas about the city, organizing donations and contributions from local vendors to feed and entertain all comers. Having already preached to most of the city over the course of the day, the clerics perform only a brief opening ceremony, dedicating the feast to Abadar, the city, and its great people. These celebrations are often quite distinct from neighborhood to neighborhood and are almost always divided along economic boundaries.</p> 
                <p>The festivities involving the wealthiest citizens usually happen on the steps of city hall or other grand civic buildings and feature the best music and food, but often little more than polite card and guessing games. These galas usually wrap up by midnight.</p> 
                <p>For the common folk, the parks and marketplaces take on a carnival atmosphere, with simple but good food, local ales, performances by talented citizens, and games of chance going on well into the night. A prevailing superstition through these festivals is that, during the celebration, it's lucky to kiss—or in some regions, pinch—a cleric of Abadar, leading to many a rosy cheeked cleric.</p> 
                <p>Even the city's poor are given reason to celebrate, as the local temple of Abadar hosts a cheery but unabashedly religious gathering on its steps, feeding all comers, doling out a hearty ration of wine, singing hymns of the faith, and providing tokens for a second wine ration for any who return to attend a service within the month.</p> 
                <p>For a holiday that revolves around paying taxes, this Abadaran festival isn't as reviled as one might expect.</p> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>Use the Chronicle sheet below to celebrate your pending tax refund or for a little escapism from the realities of whatever you may owe. And for those of you in other countries where taxes aren't due today, maybe you want to earn this boon while you can and save it for your nation's tax day.</p>

              <div itemprop="articleBody"> 
               <p><span itemprop="description">They say good things come in small packages, and in the case of this summer’s <a href="/products/btpy8xg6">Skull &amp; Shackles</a> set of <a href="/store/byCompany/w/wizKids/byProductType/pathfinderMiniatures">Pathfinder Battles</a> prepainted fantasy miniatures, they’re definitely right!</span></p> 
               <p>This week I’d like to put the spotlight on four Small figures from the set, each of which packs a punch considerably tougher than their statures might otherwise suggest.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/SkullAndShackles-Bloodbug.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/SkullAndShackles-Bloodbug_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Up first we’ve got a nasty winged pest we like to call the Bloodbug. The southern seacoasts of Golarion swarm with these guys, who have appeared in many of our adventures since the very beginning. I’m thrilled to finally have this figure available through our Pathfinder Battles line, as it’s one fans have been demanding for some time. And I must say, getting the size correct was a real chore that involved three different sculpts before we got it perfect. I think you’ll love him (and, predictably, your players will probably HATE him). Of course, you’ll need a lot of them, so we’ve slated the Bloodbug at the common rarity.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/SkullAndShackles-VineChoker.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/SkullAndShackles-VineChoker_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Bloodbugs also swarm in the jungles of Garund, where they are far from the greatest of an adventurer’s worries. Bugs are one thing, but you’ve got to look out for an environment where even the plants try to kill you. Such is the case with this fine fellow, the Vine Choker. He’s not actually a plant, but Vine Chokers have adapted natural camouflage that helps them blend into their environments, making it easier for them to sneak up on you and wring your neck. Because these guys often attack in groups, we’ve slated this figure at the common rarity.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/SkullAndShackles-Rosie.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/SkullAndShackles-Rosie_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Since we started the Pathfinder Battles line, folks have been asking for more halfling miniatures, and I’m pleased to report that this set has two of them. The first is the ever-charming Rosie Cusswell, a fellow crewmate press-ganged into the same crew that the PCs find themselves on as the <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/skullAndShackles">Skull &amp; Shackles</a> campaign begins. With her fiddle in hand, Rosie doubles as a great player character figure for a female halfling bard. She is slated at the rare rarity.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/SkullAndShackles-Eel.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/SkullAndShackles-Eel_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Not all halflings are so much fun as good old Rosie. Here we have a slippery little miscreant known as the Eel, a male halfling alchemist with a penchant for chucking bombs. I don’t want to give away how and when this character appears in the campaign, but rest assured, he arrives with a bang. The Eel also doubles as a great PC figure for a male halfling alchemist, and is slated at the rare rarity.</p> 
               <p>And that’s it for this week. There are still a ton of awesome figures just over the horizon, so until next week, man the crow’s nest and keep your eyes peeled. There’s pirates in these shark-infested waters!</p>

               <ul>
                <li>Explorations of the methodologies, advantages, and challenges of each good alignment. Examples of philosophies followed by characters of various good alignments ensure that no two chaotic good characters are the same, while suggestions on how to play alongside characters of opposing or conflicting alignments make certain your group doesn't fall apart just because the paladin caught the rogue stealing something.</li> 
                <li>Thoughts on putting good characters in bad situations and tips on how to handle moral quandaries as they apply to rules for characters such as paladins as well as for purely roleplaying purposes.</li> 
                <li>A discussion of redemption and how this might play into capturing villains both mortal and otherworldly. While that misled farmer stealing his neighbor's sheep might be redeemable, how does one go about handling a tiefling foe or even a crib full of goblin babies? Examples of possible penances and other ways characters might go about achieving atonement abound.</li>
               </ul> 
               <p>If you're tired of playing the same old lawful good holy knight or even just want to put a new spin on your chaotic good barbarian, <i>Champions of Purity</i> is an absolute don't-miss. Coming soon!</p>

              <h2>Chapter Two: Scouting Party</h2> 
              <div itemprop="articleBody"> 
               <p><span itemprop="description">The place looked more like a kicked anthill than an iron mine. Built of heavy bulwarks of timber and stone, its arms curved out from the mountain like a mother's arms around her belly. A hundred eyes peered out of the crenelated sockets, sweeping the land. The gate was simply a drawbridge that spanned a dry moat filled with dust and splintered stakes. Pitch or filth lined the bottom—it was impossible to tell from so far away. A portcullis hung ready to fall, cutting the people inside off from anything short of heavy bombardment. Parties of guards, some on foot and some on horse, went in and out, regular as an old man on a steady diet.</span></p> 
               <p>"Place is a fortress," Gunner said.</p> 
               <p>Chaplain snorted. "It's also poorly built."</p> 
               <p>"A poorly built fortress is still a fortress," Gunner grumbled.</p> 
               <p>They lapsed into silence, lying or crouching along the ridge top and drawing as little attention to themselves as possible. The guards would be unlikely to notice the band unless they moved quickly, or stood out against the backdrop of the scrub trees and hardy bushes. So they sat, waited, and watched.</p> 
               <p>"Looks as if our friend Robbes gave the commander quite the earful about what we did to his little caravan." The Lieutenant barked a rough, sharp sound that was as close as he got to laughter. "They're giving us a right heroes' welcome."</p> 
               <p>"Tell me again why we want them to know we're coming?" Trilaina asked. </p> 
               <p>Lieutenant Hook snapped his spyglass closed and slid it back among the legion of pouches slung around his narrow hips.</p> 
               <p>"It's all part of the plan." The Lieutenant scuttled back from the precipice like a crab, and the others followed, slinking and scraping out of the line of sight. Once they'd slipped into a wash, they knelt and drew close. The Lieutenant brushed the sand flat and drew in the dust. "Now pay attention."</p> 
               <p>The old man laid out the mine in small lines, giving a rough distance from the front gate to the rise they'd been watching from. He mapped out the paths visible from where they'd been sitting, like veins stretching out from a hard little heart. He carefully included the hundred yards or so of completely clear land leading up to the walls. Gunner reached over and added a few branches, his lines thicker and harder. No one questioned the gnome's eyes.</p> 
               <p>"This is our position here." The Lieutenant drew an X with his fingernail, light enough that it was barely noticeable. "We've got some daylight left, and until that fades we'll be most vulnerable. So we're going to hold this position until night falls, and when it does, we'll-"</p> 
               <p>Denna growled, jutting her head forward across the map at Trilaina. The half-elf's eyes widened and she backed away, holding her hands out in front of her.</p> 
               <p>"Denna," Gunner chided, putting a hand on her mane. </p> 
               <p>That was when an arrow buried itself in the she-wolf's side, turning her growl into a yelp of pain as she fell over.</p> 
               <p>The Irregulars stood, backs together and hands on hilts. In the time it took them to reach their feet, both ends of the little ditch filled with Molthuni soldiers. The rag-tag Andoren squad stood at the bottom, looking up at a trap they'd never even noticed. The ambushers had arrows knocked, bows taut as heartstrings and eyes cold as winter wine. A man stepped out of the scrub from behind Trilaina, pulling a new arrow from a quiver on his hip.</p> 
               <p>"Put your hands up and surrender," he commanded.</p>

                <br> Gunner and Denna make quite the team.
               </div> 
               <p>"I told you they'd be here!" A voice called from the left flank. "I saw the flash on the lens!"</p> 
               <p>"Now's not the time, Theron." The older man spoke without taking his eyes off the five interlopers and their wounded wolf. "If you do not put your hands up and surrender, I will have my men open fire."</p> 
               <p>The captured Andorens raised their hands slowly, gazes sweeping back and forth over the outriders that had clearly been dispatched to comb the foothills. They'd apparently doubled back. There was no give in them, and no relaxation as their prisoners-to-be showed empty hands.</p> 
               <p>"Irregulars," the Lieutenant said with a death's-head smile. "Smoke 'em if you got 'em."</p> 
               <p>Glass broke, and thick, yellow smoke rose in a plume around the little group. Both flanks of ambushers loosed, smooth and cool. The Lieutenant swore, and there was a gnome-sized thud as Gunner went down. The soldiers reached for more arrows, uncertain whether their targets were even still there. </p> 
               <p>Then the smoke cleared, and madness descended.</p> 
               <p>Twin daggers flicked through the air, tumbling end over end towards the left flank. One archer cried out, his words bubbling from his throat in a bloody spray. Another dropped his bow, clutching at fingers cut to the bone. Garm exploded up the hill, teeth bared in a tusked snarl that would have put fear into iron. Another Molthuni—the one their captain had called Theron—loosed a shaft, but the half-orc slapped it out of his path. His fist swung back like death's own pendulum, breaking bones and sending the injured bowman to join his companion.</p> 
               <p>Bowstrings twanged again on the right flank, but before they could be drawn a third time a single glass vial arced out of the vanishing smoke. It shattered, and bottled lightning crackled, snarling over the soldiers and leaving them twitching. Chaplain came on behind it, undaunted, swinging her hammer in a wide arc. It crushed leather and bone alike, doing its nasty work at a piston pace while the cleric drove the men down like tent stakes.</p> 
               <p>"Bastards!" The leader of the Molthuni outriders cried out as he drew an arrow’s fletching to his cheek. "You bastards, I'll—"</p> 
               <p>Whatever else he would have said was cut off by the twang of Gunner's infernal engine. He unleashed a full load of bolts in the blink of an eye, and they flew like darts flung by a giant, slamming into the trunk of the leader's chest with nary a finger's breadth between them. The man fell back, his arrow streaking for the low scudding clouds.</p> 
               <p>"Regroup!" The Lieutenant snarled, waving away the last of the smoke. "Status!"</p> 
               <p>"One prisoner, sir," Garm called. He marched Theron down the hill, one of the man's arms twisted up behind his back and Garm's hand around his throat, making certain he couldn't scream. Trilaina retrieved her daggers from the dead men and drug a double trench along each side of the soldiers' necks, just to be safe. Chaplain said a quick prayer, then rifled pouches and weapon belts looking for anything useful. Denna whined and licked Gunner. The gnome coughed, shifting on his back.</p> 
               <p>"Easy, girl." He grunted and tugged at the arrows stuck in his armor. The Lieutenant put a foot on the gnome's chest and pulled, the bent-tipped barbs grating on steel.</p> 
               <p>"Looks like the extra chain came in handy after all," The Lieutenant said. </p> 
               <p>Gunner grinned. "It's a heavy bastard, is all," he said. "Help me up, I need to see to Denna before she makes herself worse."</p> 
               <p>Chaplain gave him a hand and Gunner struggled back to his feet. He caught the she-wolf's teeth on his bracer and shushed her. He pulled, she bit, and the offending shaft slipped free with barely a protest. Gunner whispered, speaking in the voice of wind and rain while he dragged his fingers through Denna's fur like he was raking out a bloody burr. The wound came free, its lips sealed as if it had never been. Only a small bald patch gave testament.</p> 
               <p>"And here it was I thought she still didn't like me," Trilaina said. </p> 
               <p>Denna growled, a low rumble of thunder deep in her chest. Trilaina retreated a step, and Gunner scratched the wolf under the muzzle.</p> 
               <p>"She doesn't," he said. "Bastard's lucky he came from behind you. She started growling at Garm, I'd have shot first and asked questions later."</p> 
               <p>"Not my fault I'm prettier," Garm said. </p> 
               <p>Theron's eyes were wild, and he clawed at Garm's hand. The boy—which is what he really was, now that they saw him up close—may as well have tried to chop down a tree with his cheekbones.</p> 
               <p>"Beauty's in the eye of the beholder," Trilaina said, the words dry as hardroot cider. Garm dropped the boy, coughing and gagging, in front of the little map they'd drawn only moments ago. It was scuffed, but still legible.</p> 
               <p>"If you're going to kill me, just do it and get it over with." Theron had probably meant it to sound defiant, but it came out a gallows whisper. The Lieutenant hunkered across the map, looking at Theron as if he was an out-of-season fruit. Something to be picked when the opportunity presented.</p> 
               <p>"Whether you die here with no one but the gods to see is entirely up to you," Hook said. </p> 
               <p>Theron waited. The Lieutenant waited. It didn't take long for the tow-headed captive to crack.</p> 
               <p>"You'll never get in that gate," he said. "The mine is locked down and everyone's watching. Commander Hartwick has already sent word to the Cettigne garrison requesting reinforcements. They’ll be here by midday tomorrow."</p> 
               <p>"Fortunate we never intended on going in that gate," the Lieutenant said, half his mouth curling in a sly grin. "Show me where the Deserter's Door is, and you get to live."</p> 
               <p>"The Deserter's Door?" Theron asked. </p> 
               <p>The Lieutenant snapped his teeth, and the boy jumped.</p> 
               <p>"Everyone's determined to prove themselves a fool." The Lieutenant leaned forward, nostrils flaring. "The secret escape route discovered by a work crew ten years ago. It was closed up tight and guarded. It's been kept as a final option by the mine overseer since then in case of overwhelming assault, since it comes out the back side of that little hill from the front gate. You strike me as a curious boy, Theron. I'm sure you've seen it."</p> 
               <p>"And if I have?" Theron asked.</p> 
               <p>"Then you tell us where it is, and you walk," the Lieutenant said.</p> 
               <p>"Just like that?" Theron’s disbelief was obvious.</p> 
               <p>"Of course." The Lieutenant leaned in close to the boy. "The brand on your right arm labels you a conscript. You're a slave trying to make good. If you tell us where this gate is and you go back, you'll be killed for cowardice and consorting with the enemy. But if you walk away from here right now—well, there's no one to say what really happened up here, is there?" </p> 
               <p>Without hesitation, Theron stretched out an arm and marked a spot northeast of the mine's main gate. Lost in the crags, it would take them until nightfall to get there if they didn't want to be seen. </p> 
               <p>The Lieutenant smiled. "Good boy."</p> 
               <p>"So what now?" Theron asked.</p> 
               <p>The Lieutenant nodded, and Garm's fist crashed into the side of Theron's face. Blood ran, and the boy's eyes didn't quite know where to look as he tried to sit up. His teeth were still in place, and nothing appeared broken.</p> 
               <p>"You walk away." The Lieutenant stood. "That will swell up right pretty in half a turn or so. You walk out of the foothills toward the river. If someone stops you, you tell them you were sent running and got turned around—the bump to the head addled your brains. That bruise will corroborate your story and keep you from looking too much like a deserter. If you're lucky, you'll make it all the way out of Molthune, and we'll never see you again."</p> 
               <p>Theron sat, the words sinking in slow. Finally he hauled himself to his feet and offered a shaky salute. The Lieutenant returned it, and the boy walked away until he was out of sight.</p> 
               <p>"Conscripts," Garm said, and shook his head.</p> 
               <p>The Lieutenant jerked his chin toward the mountain. "There's more out there," he said. "Irregulars, keep your mouths shut, and your ears open. There are people counting on us in that mine, and I would hate to disappoint them."</p>

               <p>First up to represent additional limbs is the kokogiak. When I first presented the idea of a ten-legged polar bear the reaction was close to, "Really, Daigle?" But then I supported my brief dip into mania by explaining that I got the idea from Innuit myth (also spelled qupqugiaq), and that it's a creature that makes a person think that their loved one is lost out in the snow in order to lure the target out of safety and into its jaws. Next up is the svathurim. That is what you get if Thremyr made a frost giant into a centaur-like creature and infused them with insatiable hatred. Jason Nelson did a great job designing these two (and two other monsters in the Bestiary), so pick up Maiden, Mother, Crone to see what else is to be found in the wilds of Iobaria.</p>

               <p>Time is very precious on what looks to be a crazy busy Friday (I snuck out of a meeting just to write this, in fact!), so I'm going to keep today's preview short, sweet, and to the point.</p> 
               <p>Today we're going to talk about fish. It's shark week!</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130405-Shark.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130405-Shark_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>Up first we have, well, a Shark. This guy is Large (though not as large as another shark we'll show off in future weeks). He's mounted on a clear peg so he looks like he's swimming right for you when his figure is placed on the battle grid. You can't tell from the photo, but some of the detail inside this creature's mouth is really remarkable. The Shark is an uncommon figure.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130405-WeresharkPirate.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130405-WeresharkPirate_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>That was a cool shark, man. And here's a cool sharkman. The Wereshark Pirate is a Medium common figure, suitable for building an entire wereshark crew.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130405-Riptooth.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20130405-Riptooth_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
               </div> 
               <p>A crew of wereshark pirates needs a wereshark captain. Here we have Captain Riptooth, as nasty a pirate lord as you're likely to serve under in the Shackles Isles. Beware! Captain Riptooth has quite a temper, and if you cross him, he's likely to bite your head off! This fine fellow is a Large figure at the rare rarity.</p> 
               <p>The set also includes an uncommon Hammerhead Shark that had to go back to the sculptors for some minor cosmetic surgery and seems to have escaped photography in the meantime. We'll get an image up of him as soon as we can capture one ourselves.</p> 
               <p>Don't forget to preorder your <a href="/products/btpy8xg6">Skull &amp; Shackles</a> minis today to make sure you don't miss out on any of these exciting figures!</p> 
               <p>And that's it for the week. It is now officially safe to go back in the water!</p>

Movies aren't books, games aren't prose, and comics aren't video games. When you move between mediums, you need to understand what the essence of the source material is and do all you can to keep that core intact while adjusting the rest around it.</span></p> 
               <p>When Erik Mona invited me to pitch Paizo a plan for the Pathfinder comic series I was thrilled and intimidated at the same time. The Pathfinder setting is robust and detailed, filled to the brim with incredible story potential. Thousands of gaming groups have taken the world of Golarion and made it their own, populating it with characters and events from the sourcebooks while using it as a canvas for their own creativity. How could I filter all that great material down into a cohesive and engaging comic that would work for longtime fans but also be new-reader friendly?</p> 
               <p>I banged it around in my brain for a while and honestly thought I'd bitten off more than I could chew, until I realized the essence of what makes Pathfinder, and tabletop gaming as a whole, so great.</p> 
               <p>It's the <i>characters</i>. It's <i>always</i> been the characters.</p> 
               <p>We play these wonderful games because we want to connect with characters and with each other. The characters we make, PCs or NPCs, are storytelling avatars that empower us and entertain us.</p> 
               <p>If I could create a cast of characters that felt genuine and had the kind of playful interaction I enjoy so much around the gaming table, then it could work. Of course, all the details and rules would find their way into the comic too, but they'd be there reinforcing that core of character interaction.</p> 
               <p>Using the beautiful visual designs established for the iconics by Wayne Reynolds, I started to brainstorm who they were: their goals, mannerisms and idiosyncrasies. Once I figured that out I felt confident I could create a comic that <i>felt</i> like gaming with friends, regardless of where the actual story went.</p> 
               <p>When I get a chance to meet readers of the Pathfinder comic at conventions and they tell me they enjoy it because it reads like a great gaming session, I know we've done our job well. The essence is intact even though it's been adapted to a new medium. I'm proud of the series and excited about our second story arc arriving in 2013. If you haven't had a chance to check out the Pathfinder comic, I encourage you to browse the free samples posted here online (<a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5leiy">Part 1</a>, <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lekp">Part 2</a>, <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5leld">Part 3</a>, <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lelx">Part 4</a>) or order the upcoming <a href="/products/btpy8wr4">hardcover collection for <i>Dark Waters Rising</i></a>.</p> 
               <p>I hope you enjoy reading the Pathfinder comic as much as I'm enjoying writing it. Getting the chance to flesh out the Pathfinder iconics has been a real honor. I can't wait to level them up for many more adventures to come.</p>

              <h2>Chapter One: The Setup</h2> 
              <div itemprop="articleBody"> 
               <p><span itemprop="description">They marched like human cattle through the arid throat of the mountains. Men and women, old and young, were all subsumed into a single, shuffling, iron-bound mass. They walked with their heads down and bodies slack, broken through and through. Men wrapped in leather and steel rode snorting horses and shepherded the herd like overzealous hounds. Lashes snapped, the loud cracks of cruelty that made words unnecessary. Dust rose from bare feet and shod hooves, and the hot wind reeked like the breath of Hell welcoming new pilgrims. Just more meat for the grinder of Molthune's aspirations.</span></p> 
               <p>"There're more of them than when we saw them three days ago," Trilaina whispered. The scout lay on a flat rock, a rumpled, no-color cloth thrown over her and weighted down with sandy soil.</p> 
               <p>"More slaves or more guards?" Chaplain asked.</p> 
               <p>"Both," the half-elf replied, her lips barely parted enough to speak. Chain shifted below, down in the shade where the cleric was keeping out of sight.</p> 
               <p>"Torag will provide," Chaplain said. </p> 
               <p>Trilaina resisted the urge to turn and glare at the dwarf. "That's what you always say." </p> 
               <p>The cleric shrugged her shoulders again. "The day that I'm wrong, child, you may feel free to say 'I told you so.'"</p> 
               <p>The herd came close enough that shouts and cries pulled apart and became words. Trilaina saw faces over the groove of her crossbow, every one of them minted with the hopelessness a forced march brought. An older woman, her strength finally failing, fell over. She didn't move when the lash opened her cheek, but blood ran fast enough to testify that she wasn't dead. Not yet, anyway.</p> 
               <p>"Patience," Chaplain said, her words more of a prayer than a caution. "Be calm, and wait for the signal."</p> 
               <p>Trilaina's mouth opened to reply when a howl rolled the across the valley. As one, the guards looked, goggling like children scaring each other with campfire stories. A black she-wolf, silver in her muzzle and fire in her eyes, appeared on an outcrop. She growled down at the mass of men like a judgmental goddess, unafraid of their slings and arrows. One of the caravan guards cranked his own crossbow, raised it up, and shouted something to the others. The others laughed in reply. Trilaina couldn't hear what he said, but they were his last words.</p> 
               <p>A loud twang snapped like a split harp string, and a bolt skewered the would-be archer's head like a practice pumpkin. He sat his saddle another moment, blood dribbling to the thirsty earth, before falling like a sack full of meat. Trilaina took a breath, found her mark, and squeezed. It wasn't until her bolt tore into another guard's guts, right through the weak spot where his armor laced together up the side, that the others realized they were under attack.</p> 
               <p>Swords cleared scabbards and arrows were loosed into the rocks. Bottles smashed against the hills, and gouts of liquid fire spumed up like dragon's breath. In response, more shafts fell from both sides of the canyon, every one of them striking home. The imprisoned horde, scenting that its captors were wounded, woke up. They attacked in ones and twos at first, but then the floodgates opened full force. They pulled men off horses and snatched weapons from hands and belts. The guards that went down screamed and didn’t rise again. The horses, panicked by the potent combination of fear and rage in the air, bolted. The remaining slavers, facing the ragged wraiths bent on vengeance, followed the riderless mounts.</p> 
               <p>"They're getting away," Trilaina grunted. She snapped the reload lever and slipped another shaft along the groove.</p> 
               <p>"Not for long," Chaplain observed. </p> 
               <p>No sooner had the words been spoken than a thick rope leaped out of the soil and barred the way. It caught the riders and sent them flailing and crashing to the dirt. Trilaina sighted and squeezed carefully, catching the first to rise from the heap between the shoulder blades. The others chose to stay down, bellies up like dogs.</p> 
               <p>"You know, it's scary how you do that." Trilaina cocked the crossbow again. Chaplain hefted her hammer and smiled. She always looked matronly when she did that. Stern, but matronly.</p> 
               <p>"When you've been around as long as I have," the dwarf started.</p> 
               <p> "Then I'm sure I'll recognize the signs," Trilaina finished. She tried to brush some of the grit out of her eyes—returning her hair to its previously golden hue was going to take nothing short of a wish. She brought her weapon back into firing position. "Let's just get this over with, huh?"</p> 
               <p>"As you wish."</p> 
               <div class="blurb360">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Trilaina.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Trilaina_360.jpeg" border="0"></a>
                <br> Trilaina has little sympathy for those who traffic in flesh and misery.
               </div> 
               <p>They clambered down the rocky slope, each watching carefully while the other descended the rough patches. It wasn't pleasant, and if anyone with ill intent had been paying them the slightest mind, they could have turned both women into pincushions. But no one was watching, and soon enough their boots were back on level ground. They took a single moment to sweep the area, then headed for the far end of the battlefield, where an interesting little group had gathered.</p> 
               <p>Four former guards sat on the ground, rusty irons around their wrists. It was amazing the difference that only a few moments made in their bearing. The wolf—Denna—stood to the left with her head down and her hackles up. Gunner sat on the wolf's back, holding the infernal collection of gears, levers, and bow strings that made up his bizarre heavy crossbow. If not for his eyes—the same verdant green as his hair and mustache—the gnome could have been a statue in woodsman's clothes. On the right, glaring over his crooked nose, stood Garm. The half-orc breathed easy, stripped to the waist, muscles like steel cables flexing under his charcoal skin. Between the two of them, facing the little crowd of captives, stood the Lieutenant.</p> 
               <p>Even in a motley crew like this, Lieutenant Sturgeon Hook was impossible to miss. An old buzzard of a man, Hook seemed to have been named for the prominent nose that jutted out like a beak over his pointed chin and wispy beard. What hair he had left was white, and his skin was the ratty testament of a violent vagabond who'd weathered a storm of swords in his day. Of all the team members, he was the only one who wore a proper uniform—the faded and dust-stained blue coat of an officer in the Andoren army—yet the real proof of his rank lay in his bearing. He glanced up at the last two members of his unit, then went back to studying the prisoners.</p> 
               <p>"Looks like you caught something, Garm," Trilaina called. </p> 
               <p>The half-orc nodded, his expression thoughtful. "Trying to decide which one to keep," he finally said in his sonorous baritone.</p> 
               <p>"I'd throw em back," Gunner grunted, gesturing with the business end of his miniature ballista. "Watch ’em try to swim."</p> 
               <p>The Lieutenant ignored the banter and leaned towards the man in the center. The captive wore no armor, but was swathed in desert robes that had probably been fine some time ago. His mustache was ridiculous, his boots were ostentatious, and his fat fingers each bore a multifaceted gemstone set in heavy gold. The Lieutenant smiled, and the man on the ground shuddered.</p> 
               <p>"Harlon Robbes," the Lieutenant croaked, the smile transforming into a sneer. "A more aptly named rut-smear there never was. Where were you planning on going with so many unwilling passengers, Robbes?"</p> 
               <p>"The South Menador Mine," the slaver said. Frightened as he was, his voice was still as smooth as oiled clockwork. "They have an iron quota to fill, and they aren't shy about how they wrest the ore from the mountain."</p> 
               <p>"And since you're a patriot, you venture forth to recruit the best and the brightest to clap in irons," the Lieutenant said. The slaver shrugged, a single, spasmodic jerk. "When are they expecting you?"</p> 
               <p>"Shortly," Robbes replied, licking sweat from his cracked lips. "I was told to expect an escort by noon tomorrow."</p> 
               <p>"Ah," the Lieutenant said, as if that single fact explained everything. One of the men moved, and Denna lifted her lips. The sharp, white fangs made him decide that whatever itch he had could wait a little while longer.</p> 
               <p>"What do you think, boss?" Trilaina glanced over at the newly freed slaves. The mob looked back, a herd of sheep that had stampeded the wolves, but which still wasn't quite sure what to do.</p> 
               <p>"I think the best cure for a blight like this is a taste of its own medicine." The Lieutenant stepped back and nodded to Garm. The half-orc grabbed the manacle chain and lifted the nearest guard like a child caught misbehaving, and marched him toward the eager crowd. Chaplain grabbed a second, and Gunner gestured at a third. Before the third man could rise though, Robbes snatched the man's belt, hauled them both to their feet, and ran.</p> 
               <p>The other captives all tried their own runs for the sun. The first man struggled, wrenching his wrists and trying to throw Garm over his hip. The guard was big and broad-shouldered, but it wasn't enough. Garm smashed an elbow into the side of the slaver’s head with a hollow crunch, and the man went down like a slaughterhouse bull. The second guard pulled, and Chaplain let go. Before the prisoner could enjoy his freedom, Chaplain rung his bell with the side of her hammer, and he sprawled out flat. The third man made it four steps before something wet and sticky exploded against his back like a resinous pustule. He tripped over his own feet as the alchemical bag turned him into another graceless lump on the valley floor. Trilaina snickered, always happy to use one of her favorite toys.</p> 
               <p>Robbes hadn't relied on his own legs in some time, and it showed. Galvanized by fear, however, and with the chill of the grave on the back of his neck, he ran fast enough. The Lieutenant swore as he snatched a vial from his belt and hurled. The explosion of the bomb sent up a spray of rocks and dirt that sent the man stumbling. Gunner sighted and fired, his hands just one more part of the complex weapon. The bolt screamed, a steel-tipped falcon that slashed along the heavy, meaty expanse of the lead flesh-merchant’s shoulder. He yelped like a stuck pig and ducked, running even faster. A horse whinnied, and by the time the dust had cleared both horse and the rider were dark smudges far down the canyon.</p> 
               <p>"I told you to miss him," The Lieutenant said. </p> 
               <p>Gunner shrugged and reloaded. "He'll run faster if he's winged." </p> 
               <p>Hook blew out a long breath and shook his head. "We don't want him running too fast."</p> 
               <p>Gunner straightened in the saddle. "Sir." </p> 
               <p>Lieutenant Hook nodded and looked around at his team. They all nodded back.</p> 
               <p>"Anyone hurt?" he asked. They all shook their heads. "Good. Fine work, everyone. Consider this a step toward the final goal."</p> 
               <p>The Lieutenant knelt down, wincing, and snatched a heavy, rusted key off a dead guard's belt. He tossed it to Garm, and Trilaina took a nearly identical key off a second's man's belt. The Lieutenant nodded and rubbed at his bad knee.</p> 
               <p>"All right, let's get to work. Gunner, round up the horses and butcher them—these people are going to need some proper meat once they're not carrying around half a measure of iron each. Chaplain, soothe them as well as you can. There's quite a bit of day left to burn, and we've got to make these people disappear. The sooner we get that chore done, the sooner we get to go and play king of the mountain. Hop to!"</p>

From the very first time I opened one of Dave's manuscripts, I knew that the brilliant Count Varian Jeggare and his streetwise sidekick Radovan were exactly what I'd always been looking for without knowing it: two characters that burst with life, an odd-couple team every bit as compelling as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.

Please send a self-addressed stamped envelope to you're local Venture-Captain to receive replacements.</span></p> 
               <p>This defect is generally harmless but in some cases may result in the deterioration of ones ability to properly utilize the english language including but not limited to impoper spelling, punctuation errors; and misuse of homophones. If you have noticed any of the above in you're writing, please ensure that you sanitize all of your dice by boiling them in a 4:1 solution of apple cider vinegar and orange juice at a tempeariture of <b>no more</b> than 250° F and <b>no less</b> than 200° F for at least 12 hours immediately before play.</p> 
               <p>To make up for this this inconvenience, we have decided to allow all Pathfidner Society players to make pugwampi characters as long as their first Chronicle sheet is dated no later than <b>April 8, 20143</b>. PlYAERS USing this option are not required to bring a copy of the pugwampit rules to there sanctioned event for the GMs's review. Paizo Publishing, ;LC takes no responsibily for player death as a result of sitting at a table with a pugwampi characters and their will be no rebuilding for characters that suffers insanity or other permanent ailments do to the actions of there fellow players. Purple dice will not be permited on days ending in "why" and only red d6's can be used to confirm critical hits. Expect table variation and carry a big stick.</p> 
               <p>Again, we're sorrty for the inconvenient but we hope everyone will understand!</p> 
               <p>And, as always-don't forget to play! play! Play!</p>
