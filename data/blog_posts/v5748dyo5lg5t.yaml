  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">by Lucien Soulban</p> \n    <h2>Chapter One: Misadventure\
  \ Is Our Name</h2> \n    <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n     <p><span itemprop=\"\
  description\">Earth and sky rumbled, the hellish magma-filled fissures radiating\
  \ out from the necromancer's crumbling manse.</span></p> \n     <p>Darvin pulled\
  \ himself up, hand over hand, from one of the terrible rents as more of the stronghold\
  \ fell into the inferno. A tower tumbled and broke not a dozen feet from them, showering\
  \ the cleft with bricks and certain death. Darvin ignored the sweltering heat, intent\
  \ on saving the plump maiden on his back, her ebony arms around his neck, her squeals\
  \ of panic tickling his ears. </p> \n     <p>Fife, his halfling companion, was already\
  \ standing over them, pulling Darvin up with as much muster as his diminutive strength\
  \ allowed. Suddenly, Fife screamed and pointed past Darvin. A mass of amputated\
  \ hands, animated by the necromancer Malificar, crawled out from the labyrinth of\
  \ passageways exposed by the fissures and tremors.</p> \n     <p>\"There must be\
  \ hundreds of them!\" Fife said as Darvin cleared the edge of the fault with the\
  \ maiden Charlotte in tow.</p> \n     <p>Darvin only needed to glance at the hands\
  \ that scrabbled and vaulted up the rock wall to know, \"Five-hundred and forty\
  \ hands to be precise.\"</p> \n     <p>\"How many arrows do you have left?\" Fife\
  \ asked.</p> \n     <p>\"Two,\" Darvin said through gritted teeth. \"I'll make them\
  \ count.\"</p> \n     <p>A deep rumble shook the land and almost sent the trio to\
  \ the ground. The tremors widened the fissures, a blast of heat like the breath\
  \ of some dragon smelling of sulfur and hot death with a side order of rancid. Charlotte\
  \ squeezed his arm and pressed it between her bosoms.</p> \n     <p>\"What's happening?\"\
  \ she screamed.</p> \n     <p>Darvin looked into her soft black eyes and stroked\
  \ her cheek. He said nothing, but his eyes spoke volumes and promised: <i>Ignore\
  \ the flood of hands cresting the fissures with the sole intent of adding six new\
  \ hands to their numbers. You're safe with me, Darvin, now. By the way, this is\
  \ my half-brother, Fife</i>.</p> \n     <p>She nodded calmly but Fife screamed,\
  \ \"Run!\" Two dozen feet ahead of the half-brothers and the woman, the ground burst\
  \ open and giant fingers emerged from below, each as large as a human knight, and\
  \ armored too. The fingers dragged the giant amputated hand out from the manse's\
  \ undercroft, digging trench-like troughs in the soil. The large monstrosity blocked\
  \ their escape.</p> \n     <p>\"The Hand of Malificar!\" Fife said.</p> \n     <p>Darvin\
  \ surveyed the dire situation. Behind them skittered hundreds of hands, ready to\
  \ slice them with bladed fingers before overtaking the sleeping town below. Ahead,\
  \ the enlarged appendage of the very necromancer they'd just killed blocked their\
  \ escape. </p> \n     <p>\"Well, old friend,\" Darvin said, drawing his bow. \"\
  Looks like things have finally gotten out of hand.\"</p> \n     <p align=\"center\"\
  >∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n     <p>Everyone stared at Darvin, blinking uncertainly. Tankards thunked\
  \ wood softly, voices murmured, the smell of clove ham wafted from the kitchen and\
  \ mixed with the rich tobacco smoke of long pipes.</p> \n     <p>\"Looks like things\
  \ have finally gotten <i>out of hand</i>,\" Darvin repeated more slowly. Again,\
  \ no reaction. Darvin glanced at Fife. \"Uh.\"</p> \n     <p>\"You're not speaking\
  \ their language,\" Fife whispered. He pushed his chair out, careful to avoid the\
  \ steady drips from the ceiling.</p> \n     <p>\"Aren't we all speaking Taldane?\"\
  \ Darvin asked.</p> \n     <p>\"Honestly,\" Fife said, shaking his head. The halfling\
  \ looked at the crowd of mill workers who now stared at him. \"What my brother meant\
  \ to say was\"—Fife lowered his voice in the best impression of Darvin he could\
  \ muster—\"Fife, old friend, our asses are on the chopping block.\"</p> \n     <p>Cries\
  \ of \"Oh!\" and \"Why didn't he say so,\" exploded from around the table, the listeners\
  \ suddenly all smiles and laughter. \"Go on!\" others cheered, encouraging Darvin.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Darvin glanced at Fife, his expression wide and lost. </p> \n     <p>\"\
  The Lumber Consortium rules here,\" Fife explained with a smile. \"Know your audience.\"\
  \ </p> \n     <p>\"Save me!\" Darvin hissed.</p> \n     <p>\"With what? My, um,\
  \ what did you call it? Ah yes, ‘diminutive strength?'\" Before Darvin could respond,\
  \ Fife headed deeper into the crowd, blissfully ignoring him.</p> \n     <p>\"Go\
  \ on!\" a patron demanded. \"Get to the plump wench!\"</p> \n     <p>Fife chuckled\
  \ and moved out of earshot, sidling closer to the rock-rimmed fire pit in the center\
  \ of the Sawhorse Inn's common room as the fire drove the damp cold from his bones.\
  \ The others seated around the flames looked miserable. The river town of Oregent\
  \ survived on schedule and order, but the long rains had muted the complicated system\
  \ of bells that regulated the lives of Oregentans (<i>Orangutans</i>? he wondered).\
  \ Now the rain-pregnant waters of the Arthrosh River had overrun their boundaries\
  \ and flooded the mills and lumberyards. </p> \n     <p>In short, life for the highly\
  \ regulated employees of the Lumber Consortium had been thrown into chaos. No work\
  \ meant no money, no money among the commerce-savvy citizens meant no investments\
  \ or earnings. That left them to brood and squabble.</p> \n     <p>A low argument\
  \ slowly filtered into Fife's consciousness, the words becoming clearer over the\
  \ thrum of rain and the crackle of fire.</p> \n     <p>\"The clattering take you\
  \ both!\" a woman proclaimed. \"I tell you we're in for trouble.\"</p> \n     <p>Fife\
  \ turned to the exchange, trying not to eavesdrop, but curious. A human woman with\
  \ wide shoulders, black hair, and the arms of a mill worker sat with a burly man\
  \ with a wild red mane for a beard and a gray-haired gnome woman who smoked on a\
  \ long cork pipe and blew smoke from her button nose.</p> \n     <p>\"It's a flood,\"\
  \ the man said. \"Nothing anyone can do about it.\"</p> \n     <p>\"It'll be a week\
  \ before my employees can work and that's after the rains end.\" The human woman\
  \ bit her thumb. </p> \n     <p>\"You and everyone else,\" the gnome replied, taking\
  \ sage puffs from her pipe. \"But the Consortium is primed for a shake-up. Perhaps\
  \ not among the inner guilds, no, but among the cousin guilds there's room for expansion,\
  \ growth... acquisition for Woodland Enterprises.\" The gnome's gold eyes glittered.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"You're talking about reopening the mills before anyone else does,\"\
  \ the man said.</p> \n     <p>\"I'm talking about stealing contracts out from under\
  \ some of your rivals. Like Dannigan Lumber?\" </p> \n     <p>\"But that would mean\
  \ predicting when the floods will retreat,\" the man argued, \"and not even Dannigan\
  \ can do that until someone reaches the blasted knife gates.\"</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ trio at the table fell silent and Fife almost drifted away from the table when\
  \ the human woman cursed softly: \"Damn monsters.\"</p> \n     <p>Fife was instantly\
  \ at their table with a smile and a heart beating fast at the mention of...</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Monsters?\"</p> \n     <p>The gnome waved Fife off. \"Go away, child.\
  \ This is grownup talk.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Hey!\" Fife said, indignantly. He showed\
  \ them the soft hair on the roof of his feet. \"I'm halfling.\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  As I said,\" the gnome replied, smiling sharply.</p> \n     <p>\"You're the same\
  \ height as me!\"</p> \n     <p>\"Whatever you're selling, we're not buying,\" the\
  \ man said, barely glancing at Fife.</p> \n     <p>Fife grinned sweetly. \"I'm offering\
  \ my brother's and my services as experienced monster hunters.\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  The last ‘hunters' who entered the sewers included a wizard—\" the woman began,\
  \ but Fife interrupted her.</p> \n     <p>\"Our work is pro bono, payable at completion\
  \ of the contract against five percent projected gross earnings of your mill over\
  \ a one-month period, in addition to operating expenses for equipment and a food\
  \ allowance.\"</p> \n     <p>All three eyed Fife through squinted and suddenly wary\
  \ eyes. The human woman leaned forward. \"One percent against one week's projected\
  \ gross earnings, and an allowance limit of 10 coppers a day.\"</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ four of them were quiet, staring at one another like gladiators wielding their\
  \ favorite weapons of war. Fife cracked his knuckles and smiled in anticipation\
  \ of the coming fight...</p> \n     <p align=\"center\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n     <p>Years\
  \ later (or perhaps an hour later; it was hard to tell when it came to Fife), Darvin\
  \ would remember the moment with horrible clarity, his mind refusing to forget.\
  \ It was inexorable, like one of the three certain tragedies in life: Death, taxes,\
  \ and Fife's desperate need for adventure.</p> \n     <p>Darvin remembered regaling\
  \ the Sawhorse Inn with his exploits in \"Malificar and the Hands of Doom,\" the\
  \ audience enraptured by his skill in hand-puppetry and how it made shadows on the\
  \ wall. Then, in mid-pantomime of his great battle against the legion of hands (and\
  \ honestly, if anything shadow puppets were made for was the showing of a war of\
  \ hands), Darvin turned to see... </p> \n     <p>...Fife extending his arm to shake\
  \ the hand of a seated woman. A sudden dread hollowed him. He bolted from his chair\
  \ all too slowly, as though trapped in amber, like time congealing. He extended\
  \ his arm out, his mouth opening to scream, \"Nooooooo—\"</p> \n     <p>The chair\
  \ clattered to the ground in slow motion, Darvin pushing past patrons. Drinks flew\
  \ from their hands, Orengentans (or was that Orangutans?) pushed backward as Darvin\
  \ barreled past them and Fife gripped the woman's hands.</p> \n     <p>\"—oooooooooo—\
  \" Darvin continued. He brushed by the serving wench, upending her tray and marveling\
  \ for a moment at the sparkling rain of mead and ale that hung in the air. Fife's\
  \ hand began pumping the woman's hand in return.</p> \n     <p>\"—ooooooooo!\" Darvin\
  \ leapt and skidded across a tabletop, arriving at Fife's side just in time to hear\
  \ the halfling conclude with the three words Darvin feared most. </p> \n     <p>\"\
  It's a deal.\"</p> \n     <p align=\"center\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n     <p> \"I don't see\
  \ the problem,\" Fife complained as they made their way through the wet streets.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>The rain had polished the cobblestones slick, but closer to the\
  \ river, Darvin knew they'd start hitting the flooded and muck-covered streets.\
  \ He wanted to punish his brother with good dose of the silent treatment, but he\
  \ was too angry. From beneath his hood he glared at the halfling.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  We discussed this,\" Darvin said. \"We deal in stories. That fiasco with the hands,\"\
  \ he said, waggling his fingers. \"We agreed after that, no more misadventures.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"No more misadventures!\" Fife said, cheering.</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \ with competitors.\n     </div> \n     <p>\"Fife! We're not cut out for the real\
  \ thing!\"</p> \n     <p>\"This won't be like that business with the hands. Ah!\"\
  \ Fife glanced down at the iron grate set by the side of the road. \"This should\
  \ be it. Help me.\" </p> \n     <p>Fife removed the iron spanner from under his\
  \ cloak and wedged it between the grate's bars.</p> \n     <p>\"You're beyond help,\"\
  \ Darvin said and sniffed. He refused to budge and he refused to be budged.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Fife shrugged and used the spanner as a fulcrum with his body as the\
  \ weight. For a moment he hung there, his feet scurrying through the air, before\
  \ the grate shifted. Fife struggled it off the hole and peered down while cinching\
  \ the cloak tighter around his body, shifting his backpack and books.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>\"Ooo,\" Fife said, but Darvin refused to be baited. \"Look.\"</p> \n    \
  \ <p>\"It's a sewer.\"</p> \n     <p>\"It's a flood drain.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Where\
  \ the sewers empty. I am not swimming in that.\"</p> \n     <p>\"We won't,\" Fife\
  \ said, grinning. \"There's a small boat down there. The mill owner said so.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Then let her go sailing in that.\" Darvin motioned toward the hole.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"She'll be grateful,\" Fife sang.</p> \n     <p>\"So?\"</p> \n    \
  \ <p>\"She's plump.\"</p> \n     <p>Darvin swallowed hard and shook his head. \"\
  No, I don't care how plump she is. We're not—\"</p> \n     <p>A chuckle interrupted\
  \ them. A stranger seemed to materialize out of the rain, his wide shoulders cloaked\
  \ in gray, his face hooded but for the stub of small tusks poking out past his thick,\
  \ green lips.</p> \n     <p><i>Half-orc</i>, Darvin realized as the stranger spoke.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Are you the agents of Woodland Enterprises?\" the half-orc asked with\
  \ a voice as grizzled as his chin.</p> \n     <p>\"No,\" Darvin said. </p> \n  \
  \   <p>\"Yes,\" Fife said at the same time.</p> \n     <p>The cloak split open.\
  \ \"Then Dannigan Lumber regrets it must terminate your position!\" His hand flashed\
  \ out and Darvin watched in horror as the blade struck Fife in the chest.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Fife looked down as well, startled and pained. \"My... book,\" he gasped,\
  \ opening his wool cloak to reveal an impaled journal in his breast pocket.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The half-orc snarled and flung another dagger with the flick of his\
  \ wrist. Darvin tried to push Fife out of the way and only succeeded in spinning\
  \ him around. The dagger struck Fife in the back.</p> \n     <p>\"My other book!\"\
  \ Fife cried. \"He's after my books!\"</p> \n     <p>\"He's after us, you idiot!\"\
  \ Darvin shouted back and, before he could reconsider, pushed himself and Fife into\
  \ the exposed hole. Darkness surrounded them, and the roar of the flooded sewers\
  \ enveloped them...</p> \n     <p align=\"center\"><b>Coming Next Week</b>: The\
