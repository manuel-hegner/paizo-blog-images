  \ \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">One of the most important aspects of the Pathfinder\
  \ Roleplaying Game is combat. Monsters and villains are a very real threat that\
  \ adventurers have to deal with on a daily basis, and quiet negotiation is rarely\
  \ the answer. When talking fails, swords are drawn and combat is joined. In Pathfinder\
  \ First Edition, combat could become rather bogged down just by the weight of options\
  \ available. Time and time again, we heard new players talk about the complexity\
  \ of the action system, how it made the game slow down as players looked to eke\
  \ the most out of their turns.</p> \n     <p>Basically, the previous system was\
  \ a barrier, and so it should come as no surprise that we are looking at ways that\
  \ we can simplify it to make the game run more smoothly and intuitively. The hard\
  \ part was making sure that the versatility of the old system was still present,\
  \ while cleaning up the overall experience. We want your turn in combat to be exciting\
  \ and full of interesting choices. We want you to be elated by coming up with just\
  \ the right combination of actions to win the day. We just don't want those choices\
  \ to be hedged in by a number of complex categories.</p> \n     <h2>Seven Types</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>Before I explain the new way of doing things, it might be good to look\
  \ back to find some perspective. The previous edition of Pathfinder featured seven\
  \ distinct action types: free, full-round, immediate, move, standard, swift, and\
  \ a nebulously defined “other” category. These helped to curb what a character could\
  \ do and encouraged varied tactics to get the most out of your round. In particular,\
  \ the immediate action was of interest because it was something you could do outside\
  \ your turn.</p> \n     <p>This approach has served us well over the years, but\
  \ we have long looked for better ways to accomplish some of the same goals with\
  \ a more intuitive system.</p> \n     <h2>Three Actions</h2> \n     <p>It's your\
  \ turn. You get to take three actions. That's it. You want to move three times?\
  \ Done. Instead you want to move once, draw your sword, and attack? No problem.\
  \ How about attack three times? Go ahead (but you'll take an increasing penalty\
  \ for each additional attack). With only a few notable exceptions, most things in\
  \ the game now take one action to accomplish. Opening a door, drawing a weapon,\
  \ reloading a crossbow, moving up to your speed, raising your shield, taking a guarded\
  \ step, swinging your greataxe—all of these and much more take just one action to\
  \ perform.</p> \n     <p>There are, of course, some exceptions. A few things don't\
  \ take an action at all, like talking or dropping a weapon. Conversely, most of\
  \ the spells in the game take two actions to cast, although some can be cast quickly,\
  \ such as a heal spell that targets yourself. Many of the classes can teach you\
  \ specific activities that take two more actions to perform. The fighter, for example,\
  \ has a feat that you can select called Sudden Charge, which costs two actions but\
  \ lets you to move twice your speed and attack once, allowing fighters to get right\
  \ into the fray!</p> \n     <h2>One Reaction</h2> \n     <p>One aspect of Pathfinder\
  \ First Edition that was important to us was the ability to occasionally, if the\
  \ circumstances were right, act outside your turn. While this was most often a simple\
  \ attack of opportunity, we saw this as a way to add a whole new dimension to the\
  \ game.</p> \n     <p>So now, all characters get one reaction they can take when\
  \ the conditions are right.</p> \n     <p>Reactions always come with a trigger that\
  \ must occur before the reaction can be taken. Let's say you're playing a paladin\
  \ with a shield and you have spent an action to defend yourself with that shield.\
  \ Not only does this boost your Armor Class; it also allows you to take a special\
  \ reaction if you are hit by an attack. This shield block reduces the damage taken\
  \ by an amount up to the shield's hardness!</p> \n     <p>Not everybody will have\
  \ a reaction they can use during combat, but you can always ready an action that\
  \ allows you prepare a special action that you can take later if the conditions\
  \ you specify are met. You might ready an action to attack the first orc that walks\
  \ around the corner, allowing you to make a strike if that happens before your next\
  \ turn.</p> \n     <p>Finally, some monsters have reactions they can take as well.\
  \ While some have simple reactions that allow them to attack those who drop their\
  \ guard while adjacent to them, others have wildly different abilities. An earth\
  \ elemental, for example, can spend its reaction after being hit to crumble into\
  \ a pile of rocks, burrowing down into the ground for safety.</p> \n     <h2>The\
  \ New System in Practice</h2> \n     <p>The three-action-and-a-reaction system really\
  \ has done a lot for gameplay around the office. Turns are quite a bit more dynamic.\
  \ The breadth of options now compete with each other, not based upon what action\
  \ type they are, but instead on their merits in the current combat situation. Concentrating\
  \ on a spell might be vital, but not if you need to move away, draw a potion, and\
  \ drink it. Maybe you could wait to drink it until your next turn to keep the spell\
  \ going, or maybe you could not move and hope the monster does not eat you.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Most importantly, taking your turn in Pathfinder is now filled with\
  \ a wide variety of possibilities, allowing you to get the most out of your time\
  \ in the spotlight, while still keeping the game moving and engaging.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>Well, that about wraps up our in-depth look at the new action system for Pathfinder.\
  \ Come back on Friday for a blog post looking into all of the spoilers from the\
  \ first part of the Glass Cannon Network's podcast of their playtest of the game.\
