  \ John Compton and I can get a tad excited about campaign storylines. When we first\
  \ sat down to start hashing out the first wave of Starfinder Society scenarios,\
  \ we came up with a huge list of ideas that pulled from popular Pathfinder Society\
  \ scenarios, common sci-fi tropes and more. Of these ideas, perhaps none stood out\
  \ more than one fateful thought I threw into the mix after reading about Eox: \"\
  What if we have the Starfinders take part in a reality TV show?\"</p> \n    <p>Welcome\
  \ to <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9x0x?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-109-Live-Exploration-Extreme\"\
  ><i>Starfinder Society #1–09: Live Exploration Extreme</i></a>! Written by Paizo's\
  \ own, John Compton, this scenario had one of the most attention-catching premises\
  \ that we came across during the time when we sat down to pitch the 2017/2018 scenario\
  \ roster. I knew it was a success when during the process, we went through discussing\
  \ each of the scenarios, got to this one, and John ended the conversation with a\
  \ quick \"Ok, I'll write this one.\"</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\">\n     <a\

  \ \n    <p>Well John, after so many times writing scenarios for you… THE TABLES\
  \ HAVE FINALLY TURNED!</p> \n    <p>Joking aside, <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9x0x?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-109-Live-Exploration-Extreme\"\
  ><i>Live Exploration Extreme</i></a> is an important scenario for several reasons.\
  \ First off, it's back to basics in terms of being a Tier 1–4 scenario. Second,\
  \ it brings the Starfinder Society back into the mysterious false moon of <i>Salvation's\
  \ End</i> that we last explored in <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9tsv?Starfinder-Society-Special-100-Claim-to-Salvation\"\
  ><i>Starfinder Society Scenario #1–00: Claim to Salvation</i></a>. Finally (at least\
  \ for what I can describe in this blog), this scenario brings the idea of celebrities\
  \ and icons to the forefront of Starfinder. I would highly suggest that if you have\
  \ a character with the Icon theme or are even slightly interested in dabbling in\
  \ the realm of \"stellar celebrity\" that you give this scenario a shot!</p> \n\
  \    <p>Much of what occurs during this scenario is a spoiler-filled minefield,\
  \ so rather than talk too much about the plot, I want to talk about media overload.\
  \ A camera crew accompanies the PCs during most of this adventure, and if that weren't\
  \ enough, the PCs need to put on a good show in order to impress influential Society\
  \ allies (who may or may not have an exclamation point in their name, similar to\
  \ the title of this scenario). Be aware that this scenario plays off a lot of tropes\
  \ of modern reality TV, replete with moments for PCs to embellish their combat actions\
  \ to set up \"just the right shot\" or even take some time after combat to privately\
  \ reminisce (or harshly critique) the actions of fellow party members inside \"\
  the booth.\" More than most scenarios, <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9x0x?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-109-Live-Exploration-Extreme\"\
  ><i>Live Exploration Extreme</i></a> is about consent; the goal is to have a fun\
  \ time and not have players feel out of place because of themes or rules of the\
  \ scenario. The scenario makes sure to spell this out to the GMs, so for players\
  \ concerned about the potential media and social overload associated with reality\
  \ TV, I would still consider giving this scenario a shot—after all, sometimes it's\
  \ the one quip from the character who's said nothing else the entire episode that\
  \ defines a show! This scenario has no scenario tags.</p> \n    <p>Looking ahead\
  \ to March, we have <a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9y4l/discuss?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-110-The-HalfAlive-Streets\"\
  ><i>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-10: The Half-Alive Streets</i></a> and <a href=\"\
  http://paizo.com/products/btpy9y4m?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-111-In-Pursuit-of-the-Scoured-Past\"\
  ><i>Starfinder Society Scenario #1-11: In Pursuit of the Scoured Past </i></a>which\
  \ I've just finished my development pass on. While I want to keep all those secrets\
  \ until next month's preview, I think both scenarios include some standout stories\
  \ that should engage new and veteran Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild players.\
  \ Past these two (yes, next month begins our publishing two scenarios per month)\
  \ we start getting into a wide array of new scenarios that lead into the quickly\
  \ approaching convention season…</p> \n    <p>Speaking of convention season, I think\
  \ I need to get back to development! There's a lot of exciting stuff coming up in\
  \ just the next few months. Also, be on the lookout for a post in the coming weeks\
  \ discussing our season transition and plans taking us past the summer convention\
  \ season.</p> \n    <p>See you on the other side of the Drift.</p> \n    <p>Thurston\
  \ Hillman<br> <i>Starfinder Society Developer</i></p> \n    <p><b>PS:</b> Special\
  \ shout-out to Paizo's Customer Service Manager, Sara Marie, for helping to inspire\
  \ this month's scenario. I first discovered the joys of combining reality TV and\
  \ tabletop RPGs when I played in her Survivor-themed game during a past PaizoCon.\
  \ Of course, I may have rose-tinted memories of that game because of how many times\
  \ my character managed to snag the immunity idol…</p> \n   </div> \n  </blockquote>\
