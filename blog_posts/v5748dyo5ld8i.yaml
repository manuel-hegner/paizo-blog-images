  \ largest benefits of working as developer on a shared-world campaign like Pathfinder\
  \ Society Organized Play is having the ability to gather data about how the community\
  \ uses our products and improve them based on that data. In addition to the extremely\
  \ helpful Pathfinder Society messageboards, where Campaign Coordinator Mike Brock\
  \ and I can interact directly with some of our most active and engaged GMs and players,\
  \ we also have the benefit of looking at literally thousands of tables’ worth of\
  \ reported session data entered by GMs and event coordinators. This goldmine of\
  \ information lets us keep a close eye on campaign trends, such as what level scenarios\
  \ are most often played, which are particularly deadly, and what factions have a\
  \ higher rate of success in their respective missions. When combined, the synergy\
  \ of objective data from session reports and subjective feedback from the messageboards,\
  \ direct email and personal interaction with players and GMs, and a mixture of the\
  \ two from our growing network of volunteer regional coordinators is nearly unmatched,\
  \ at least compared to the level of feedback we can get on our other product lines.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>About this time last year, prompted by community feedback, I started looking\
  \ closely at the average size of tables in Pathfinder Society games. Specifically,\
  \ I was looking at what percentage of reported sessions were played by six or more\
  \ PCs. The evidence was staggering. While seven-person tables are a relative rarity\
  \ (as they should be), six-person tables are undoubtedly the norm in Pathfinder\
  \ Society Organized Play. So I took that data and let it simmer for a while as I\
  \ continued my routine development tasks.</p> \n   <p>A few months ago, in a conversation\
  \ with Mike and a few other members of the editorial team, we were bouncing around\
  \ the idea of giving GMs a little bit more power to scale adventures to accommodate\
  \ parties of different sizes. Coming up with a means for GMs to scale encounters\
  \ up proved incredibly difficult, and there wasn’t an elegant or easily implemented\
  \ solution. But putting in guidelines for scaling encounters down was much easier.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Thus, beginning in Season 4, all Pathfinder Society scenarios will be\
  \ designed with six PCs in mind, effectively increasing the CR of all encounters\
  \ to accommodate larger parties. Each adventure will provide specific changes to\
  \ apply for parties of four PCs, maintaining consistency in how the scenarios are\
  \ altered, but giving a bit more latitude to account for table variance. Because\
  \ five- and seven-person tables are both reasonably equipped to handle a six-person\
  \ challenge, tables of both sizes should be run without any changes.</p> \n   <p>So\
  \ that’s the plan! In true Pathfinder Society fashion, however, we’re eager to hear\
  \ what the community thinks, so be sure to leave your thoughts in the comments below!\
  \ And because we like you all so much, here’s a piece of art from the recently released\
  \ Pathfinder Society Exclusive Scenario: The Cyphermage Dilemma, which your local\
  \ regional coordinator or 4- or 5-star GM can run for you.</p> \n   <p>Mark Moreland<br>\
