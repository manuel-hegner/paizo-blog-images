  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, May 12, 2008</p> \n   <p>In \"<a href=\"/store/v5748btpy82u9\"\
  >A History of Ashes</a>,\" you'll be introduced to a wide cast of misfits, troublemakers,\
  \ heroes, anti-heroes, and outright villains. The complicated part? For many of\
  \ these NPCs, which of those roles they'll end up playing will depend on how the\
  \ PCs interact with them. One such character is the mysterious Cinderlander, a man\
  \ whose family was slaughtered by the Shoanti, leaving him with nothing but a burning\
  \ need for vengeance. He abandoned his former life and walked into the Cinderlands,\
  \ where he became a figure of legend—many Shoanti believing that the Cinderlander\
  \ can't be a living man, but rather a spirit of wrath fueled by men slain during\
  \ these raids into the southern lowlands.</p> \n   <p>After years of hunting and\
  \ killing Shoanti, the Cinderlander gradually achieved two cynical epiphanies—first,\
  \ no matter how many Shoanti he killed in his lifetime, there would always be more;\
  \ and second, that the Shoanti were already a doomed culture, gradually being crushed\
  \ between civilization to the south and more brutal orcs to the north. His righteous\
  \ fury largely exhausted, the Cinderlander now rents himself out as a guide for\
  \ those who seek to cross the Cinderlands in safety, facilitating the inland travel\
  \ of southerners. He secretly resents the paradox that over the years he has gradually\
  \ become far more like the Shoanti he hunts than the Chelaxian heritage he thought\
  \ he was defending, yet he knows little else. </p> \n   <p>James Jacobs <br> <i>Pathfinder</i>\
