  \   </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">It’s strange what\
  \ the mind will do when faced with a significant trauma. Some people scream or fight,\
  \ others retreat inward, still others flee. As Droven’s storm-tossed ship was flung\
  \ into the air only to crash and shatter upon the rocky shoals of Arcadia’s coastline,\
  \ he found a strange calm settle over him. Even as a wooden spar tore free of its\
  \ rigging and smashed apart his arm, he found himself calmly analyzing the situation.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Clearly, the expedition was a failure. He couldn’t find any of the other\
  \ Pathfinders who had boarded ship with him, though for some reason he couldn’t\
  \ seem to see out of his left eye anymore, so maybe they were nearby. The ship was\
  \ clearly a loss, though. Even if its frame were somehow dragged ashore and enough\
  \ of its crew survived to sail it home, the islets they’d crashed upon seemed unlikely\
  \ to provide the timber necessary for repairs.</p> \n     <p>As Droven considered\
  \ the likelihood of the ship even being repairable, another surge from the screaming\
  \ winds and waves cast the battered wreck into the air once more, this time flipping\
  \ the ship complete over. Droven’s last thought as he sank beneath the waves was\
  \ that repairs <em>definitely</em> weren’t going to be an option.</p> \n     <center>\n\

  \ by a small mechanical goblin with a toolbox built into its back\"></a><em> Illustration\
  \ by Wayne Reynolds</em> \n     <p>Much to his surprise, Droven awoke sometime later.\
  \ His mouth was parched and dry and he still couldn’t make anything out through\
  \ his left eye. Attempting to lever himself to his feet revealed that the arm that\
  \ had likely saved him from a crushing death earlier was now incapable of supporting\
  \ his weight. Worse, it seemed very likely to become a painful liability in short\
  \ order. </p> \n     <p>Realizing that he had little time to spare, Droven spent\
  \ the rest of the day confirming that he was alone on what he discovered to be a\
  \ small islet, part of a chain ringing a larger bay between him and the continent\
  \ of Arcadia proper. For supplies, he found only a half-empty wineskin and some\
  \ brine-soaked hard tack. As he washed the salty biscuits down with stale wine,\
  \ Droven found himself musing. “Whoever came up with the saying ‘any port in a storm’\
  \ almost certainly never saw that storm or this ‘port’. Ah, well. Am I a Pathfinder\
  \ or not? There is an unexplored horizon ahead and if I’m to live, I’ll need to\
  \ find a path from here to there.”</p> \n     <p>Twisting the fingers of his right\
  \ hand into the sign of the key, holy symbol of Abadar, god of civilization, Droven\
  \ invoked one last blessing to his lost compatriots. “May your works stand forever\
  \ in the First Vault as testament to your skills and may the god that suits you\
  \ each best watch over you. And if you have already claimed your final reward, do\
  \ me a favor and distract any sharks between here and the coast. It’d be a shame\
  \ to survive such a wreck only to feed the fish.”</p> \n     <p>His prayer complete,\
  \ Droven grabbed the largest piece of wood he could find in the wreckage for floatation,\
  \ bound his shattered arm in a tattered sling made from linen he suspected was once\
  \ part of the wrecked ship’s sails, and began slowly swimming to shore.</p> \n \
  \    <p>Each stroke was an exercise in pain and every lapping wave seared his wounds\
  \ with salt water, but somehow he reached the shore. He tried to stand and walk\
  \ as the wooden plank ground into the beach, but he made it only a few steps before\
  \ collapsing in a heap. As exhaustion weighed his eye shut, he thought he saw leather-booted\
  \ feet moving towards him. Clinging to the optimism that had allowed him to shrug\
  \ off pain and prejudice throughout his life, he hoped they belonged to someone\
  \ friendly. Or at least, interesting.</p> \n     <p>Droven’s rescuer was a half-orc\
  \ man named Darv, older than Droven by many years and with gray staining his long\
  \ black hair. Darv and his family were from the Illani Plains, many miles to the\
  \ northwest, but had settled here after a dispute with another nomadic clan had\
  \ threatened to turn to violence. Darv was a gunsmith, skilled in the crafting of\
  \ firearms both like and unlike those Droven had occasionally seen make their way\
  \ to Absalom from Alkenstar. Darv’s son and son-in-law, Joach and Nadkym, operated\
  \ a small smithy, where they forged armor, clockwork prosthetics, and other mechanical\
  \ devices on par with, and often superior to, anything Droven had seen produced\
  \ at Absalom’s Clockwork Cathedral.</p> \n     <p>Darv had been forced to amputate\
  \ Droven’s arm to save his life, and Joach and Nadkym had already begun work on\
  \ a prosthetic by the time Droven fully came to his senses and recovered enough\
  \ from the wreck to move about. With nowhere to go and nothing but time on his hands,\
  \ Droven joined them at the forge. Much of Droven’s knowledge of alchemy was useless\
  \ here, so far from the plants and reagents with which he was familiar, but his\
  \ keen mind was quick to unravel the secrets of clockwork mechanisms and forging\
  \ techniques. He was able to assist in the construction of his new prosthetic arm,\
  \ adding modifications to assist him in adventuring when the time inevitably came\
  \ that he felt well enough to begin seeking a way back home to Absalom.</p> \n \
  \    <p>The healing process, as well as acclimating to his new arm, was a slow affair,\
  \ filled with long and painful days of careful physical therapy to rebuild his strength\
  \ and renew his coordination. Droven spent much of his free time tinkering with\
  \ a clockwork construct. “What exactly do you have there?” Darv would ask each day.\
  \ “All it does is whirp and spin around while looking like a goblin that fell in\
  \ a smelting vat!” And each day Droven would reply “It reminds me of home, and an\
  \ old friend. Plus, one day I’ll find a way back to Absalom and I can’t expect your\
  \ family to accompany me on such a journey! I’ll need company.”</p> \n     <p>Darv’\
  s constant references to the clockwork’s “whirping” stuck, and the little mechanical\
  \ device—primarily a toolbox but one with an unusual propensity for offering assistance\
  \ without being asked—was soon known as Whirp to everyone, including Droven.</p>\
  \ \n     <center>\n      <hr width=\"50%\">\n     </center> \n     <p>As Droven’\
  s inquisitive mind devoured everything Darv and his family could teach on the subject\
  \ of clockworks and forge techniques, the Pathfinder eventually realized that the\
  \ time had come for him to seek a way back to Absalom. As he packed a backpack with\
  \ supplies, Jaoch and Nadkym presented their departing friend with weapons they\
  \ had forged for him in secret: a hammer integrated with a variety of useful tools\
  \ for repairing Whirp, and a finely crafted dagger. Darv gave his young friend a\
  \ pair of armored boots and an admonition. “The soles on these will take you a good\
  \ while to wear out, my friend. If you still haven’t found a way back home by the\
  \ time they’re worn thin, come back here, instead. You’ll always have a home.”</p>\
  \ \n     <p>With a nod and a smile, Droven and his new companion, Whirp, began their\
  \ long search for a way back to his home in Absalom, starting by heading toward\
  \ the land Darv and his family had spoken so fondly of—the Illani Plains.</p> \n\

  \ Droven’s story by bringing your attention to two organizations that are very important\
  \ to me. The first is the <a href=\"https://support.woundedwarriorproject.org/default.aspx\"\

  \ medical service assistance for members of the armed forces injured in the line\
