  alt: "Artist Justin Usher : On a bright, sunny day a Polynesian-inspired dinghy\
    \ pulls up to an island with a waterfall on the left and mountains in the distance.\
    \ Behind the waterfall, there's a subtle sillhouette of a woman. The ocean surrounding\
    \ the island is a comforting aqua blue. Taiwalei, a human Pathfinder, faces the\
    \ viewer, excitedly beckoning toward the island, smiling and eager for the adventure\
    \ ahead"
