  \ <a href=\"http://us.battlefoam.com\" target=\"_blank\">Battle Foam</a> has lead\
  \ the gaming industry in cases and custom foam storage solutions. The dedication\
  \ to quality, customer service, and community support has helped grow Battle Foam\
  \ into a global company. Battle Foam over the years has partnered with many great\
  \ gaming companies. Solid partnerships between gaming companies allows both parties\
  \ to successfully bring a great product to market. Both teams can discuss in detail\
  \ what their customers need and what will best provide the ultimate storage solution.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>About a year ago the amazing people at Paizo and Battle Foam held a meeting\
  \ to partner on a new Pathfinder storage solution. After many months of hard work\
  \ from both parties <a href=\"http://us.battlefoam.com/bags-26/\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >the official Pathfinder Battle Foam bag</a> was created. This new storage solution\
  \ truly covers all the bases when it comes to transporting your role playing books,\
  \ papers, and models. The rugged design of the Battle Foam bags have proven to outlast\
  \ the most grueling of tournament or gamer travel. Each Pathfinder bag features\
  \ a hard plastic shell interior with a rugged outer waterproof skin. The Pathfinder\
  \ bag has pockets and storage areas specifically designed for collectors of role\
  \ playing style games.</p> \n    <p>The <a href=\"http://us.battlefoam.com/bags-26/\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Pathfinder bag</a> also features the ultra soft but durable\
  \ Battle Foam foam trays. Each tray comes with a lifetime warranty on separation\
  \ from its bottom and are cut to the exact sizes needed for Pathfinder minis. One\
  \ of the coolest features of the Pathfinder bags is the MOLLE accessories system\
  \ that each bag features on both sides. This area was inspired by the US military\
  \ and allows the customer to attach any number of accessory items to the sides of\
  \ the bag. This options really makes the bag a totally customizable solution for\
  \ just about any game type.</p> \n    <p>The Pathfinder bag from Battle Foam can\
  \ be purchased directly <a href=\"http://us.battlefoam.com/bags-26/\" target=\"\
  _blank\">on our website</a> and ships in just a couple days from time of order.\
  \ With warehouses in both the US and UK, Battle Foam can handle any order quickly\
  \ and easily with their great customer service. Check out the images and video below\
  \ to learn more about this new carrying case!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
