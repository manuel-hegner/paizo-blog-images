  \ from the Sands</b></a>: A forgotten pharaoh rises in this year's Free RPG Day\
  \ adventure, a perfect one-shot quest to play at your favorite game store or add\
  \ to your home campaign. Aside from featuring a complete delve through an ancient,\
  \ unexplored pyramid, <i>Risen from the Sands</i> includes a playable preview of\
  \ four of the new classes in the upcoming <a href=\"/products/btpy95d1\"><i>Pathfinder\
  \ Roleplaying Game Advanced Class Guide </i></a>! Play <i>Risen from the Sands</i>\
  \ as one of four pregenerated characters—the daring swashbuckler, cunning investigator,\

  \ in game stores this August.</p> \n     <p>Also, to help run your Risen from the\
  \ Sands adventure, check out the two Bestiary 4 monster templates below. GMs will\

  \ \n        <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Mummified Creature</p> \n        <p>\"\
  Mummified creature\" is an acquired template that can be added to any living corporeal\
  \ creature (hereafter referred to as the base creature). A mummified creature uses\
  \ all of the base creature's statistics except as noted here.</p> \n        <p><b>CR</b>:\
  \ Same as the base creature +1.<br> <b>Alignment</b>: Any evil.<br> <b>Type</b>:\
  \ The creature's type changes to undead (augmented). It retains any other subtypes\
  \ as well, except for alignment subtypes and subtypes that indicate kind. Do not\
  \ recalculate class HD, BAB, saves, or skill points.<br> <b>Senses</b>: A mummified\
  \ creature gains darkvision 60 feet.<br> <b>Aura</b>: A mummified creature gains\
  \ a frightful presence aura with a range of 30 feet and a duration of 1d6 rounds.<br>\
  \ <b>Armor Class</b>: Natural armor improves by +4.<br> <b>Hit Dice</b>: Change\
  \ all racial Hit Dice to d8s. Class Hit Dice are unaffected. As an undead, a mummified\
  \ creature uses its Charisma modifier to determine bonus hit points (instead of\
  \ Constitution).<br> <b>Defensive Abilities</b>: A mummified creature gains DR 5/—\
  \ and the defensive abilities granted by the undead type.<br> <b>Weaknesses</b>:\
  \ The mummification process leaves a mummified creature vulnerable to a single energy\
  \ type. Choose or determine randomly from the following list. d10 Energy 1 Electricity\
  \ 2–3 Acid 4–7 Fire 8–9 Cold 10 Sonic As a fail-safe in case of rebellion, a mummified\
  \ creature is subtly marked during the ritual process with a hieroglyph someplace\
  \ inconspicuous on its body or wrappings that identifies the particular energy type\
  \ to which it is vulnerable. A successful DC 20 Perception check is needed to find\
  \ the mark, but a successful DC 25 Linguistics check is still required to decipher\
  \ the hieroglyph's meaning.<br> <b>Speed</b>: Decrease all speeds by 10 feet (to\
  \ a minimum of 5 feet). If the base creature has a f light speed, its maneuverability\
  \ changes to clumsy.<br> <b>Attacks</b>: The mummification process hardens the mummified\
  \ creature's bones to a stone-like density, granting the mummified creature a powerful\
  \ slam attack if the base creature has no other natural attacks. This slam attack\
  \ deals damage based on the mummified creature's size (Bestiary 302), treating the\
  \ creature as if it were one size category larger.<br> <b>Special Attacks</b>: A\
  \ mummified creature gains the following special attacks.<br> </p>\n        <blockquote>\
  \ <b>Burst of Vengeance (Su)</b>: Despite its slow, lumbering nature, a mummified\
  \ creature is capable of lurching forward to attack with a short but surprising\
  \ explosion of speed. Twice per day as a swift action, a mummified creature may\
  \ act as if affected by a haste spell for 1 round.\n         <br> <b>Dust Stroke\
  \ (Su)</b>: A creature killed by a mummified creature's natural attack or slam attack\
  \ is disintegrated into a cloud of dust and ash, completely destroying the victim's\
  \ body (as disintegrate).\n         <br> \n        </blockquote> <b>Abilities</b>:\
  \ Str +4, Int –2 (minimum 1). As an undead creature, a mummified creature has no\
  \ Constitution score.\n        <br> <b>Feats</b>: A mummified creature gains Toughness\
  \ as a bonus feat, and Improved Natural Attack as a bonus feat for each of the base\
  \ creature's natural attacks.\n        <br> <b>Skills</b>: A mummified creature\
  \ gains a +4 racial bonus on Stealth checks.\n        <p> </p>\n        <p class=\"\
  stat-block-title\">Zombie Lord</p> \n        <p>\"Zombie lord\" is an acquired template\
  \ that can be added to any corporeal creature (other than undead) that has a minimum\
  \ Intelligence of 3. This corporeal creature is referred to hereafter as the base\
  \ creature.</p> \n        <p><b>CR</b>: A zombie lord's CR is 1 higher than that\
  \ of a normal zombie with the same Hit Dice, plus the normal CR increase for class\
  \ levels (if any).<br> <b>Type</b>: The creature's type becomes undead. It keeps\
  \ subtypes except for alignment subtypes and subtypes that indicate kind.<br> <b>Alignment</b>:\
  \ Any evil.<br> <b>Armor Class</b>: Natural armor as per zombie (Pathfinder RPG\
  \ Bestiary 288).<br> <b>Hit Dice</b>: Change all of the creature's racial Hit Dice\
  \ to d8s, then add 2 racial Hit Dice to this total (creatures without racial HD\
  \ gain 2 undead HD). Hit Dice from class levels are unchanged.<br> <b>Saving Throws</b>:\
  \ Base save bonuses for racial Hit Dice are Fort +1/3 HD, Ref +1/3 HD, and Will\
  \ +1/2 HD + 2.<br> <b>Defensive Abilities</b>: A zombie lord gains DR 5/slashing\
  \ and channel resistance +4, in addition to undead traits.<br> <b>Speed</b>: As\
  \ zombie (Bestiary 288).<br> <b>Attacks</b>: As zombie (Bestiary 289).<br> <b>Abilities</b>:\
  \ Str +2, Dex +2. As an undead, it has no Constitution score.<br> <b>BAB</b>: A\
  \ zombie lord's BAB for its racial HD is equal to 3/4 its HD.<br> <b>Skills</b>:\
  \ A zombie lord gains skill ranks per racial Hit Die equal to 4 + its Int modifier\
  \ (class skills as the undead type). Skills gained from class levels remain unchanged.<br>\
  \ <b>Feats</b>: A zombie lord gains Toughness as a bonus feat.<br> <b>Special Qualities</b>:\
  \ Unlike a common zombie, a zombie lord does not gain the staggered special quality.</p>\
