  \ class=\"PTales\"></div></a> \n   <h1>A Tomb of Winter's Plunder</h1> \n   <p>by\
  \ Tim Pratt</p> \n   <h2>Chapter Four: Poison and Knives</h2> \n   <p>\"I will <i>not</i>,\"\
  \ Alaeron said. \"I won't risk my life to enrich you.\"</p> \n   <p>Rodrick clucked\
  \ his tongue in disappointment. \"Ah, you misunderstand me! To go down into the\
  \ linnorm's treasure chamber is to risk death, certainly. But to refuse is to <i>ensure</i>\
  \ your death. Because if you do not, I will cut you down where you stand. Ah, ah!\
  \ Don't reach for any of your little vials or potions, please. Then I'd have to\
  \ cut off your hands, and you'd have a terrible time gathering riches for me with\
  \ your stumps.\"</p> \n   <p>\"We can divide the coins and gems that remain here,\"\
  \ Alaeron said, feeling desperate but trying to sound reasonable. \"We can take\
  \ the armor off Uncle Brant, that's valuable, surely—\"</p> \n   <p>\"The sword\
  \ is the most important thing, I think,\" Rodrick said. \"I've heard great things\
  \ about that sword—it has a blade of living ice, Simeon said, whatever <i>that</i>\
  \ means, and was reputed to possess its own intelligence and give wise counsel.\
  \ If you see any rings or cloaks or helms, I'll need those too. Feel free to scoop\
  \ up any particularly fine gems—they're worth more than gold by weight.\"</p> \n\
  \   <p>\"What if I wake the linnorm?\" Alaeron said. \"Then you risk your own death\
  \ as well.\"</p> \n   <p>\"I suspect the beast will spend long enough killing you\
  \ to allow <i>me</i> to escape,\" Rodrick said. \"I'm good at escapes. But I have\
  \ great faith in you, alchemist! Surely you have some tinctures there that will\
  \ allow you to move silently, to be fleet of foot, and so on?\"</p> \n   <p>Alaeron\
  \ did, of course, but who knew how perceptive the linnorm was, or how deeply it\
  \ slumbered?</p> \n   <p>But what choice did he have? \"All right,\" he said finally.\
  \ \"But what proof do I have that you'll let me live when I return with your treasure?\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"I'll have no particular reason to kill you, then,\" Rodrick said.\
  \ \"I don't have any particular <i>qualms</i> about killing people, but it's not\
  \ something I go out of my way to do—it's messy and unpleasant. I'll settle for\
  \ knocking you out and leaving you in the tomb, fear not. And even if I'm lying...\
  \ what choice do you have?\"</p> \n   <p>Alaeron looked at the hole gaping in the\
  \ wall, and crept inside.</p> \n   <p>He crawled partway down the slope, then paused.\
  \ He wouldn't be able to take Rodrick in a fight, and the thief wasn't nearly as\
  \ stupid as Alaeron would have preferred, but the alchemist might still win in a\
  \ battle of wits. \"Make yourself comfortable, Rodrick,\" he said, raising his voice\
  \ just enough for it to carry. \"You should be feeling the effects soon.\"</p> \n\
  \   <p>Rodrick's voice drifted down from above. \"You're wasting time, alchemist.\
  \ Hurry along and bring me back my sword.\"</p> \n   <p>\"It's not a terribly <i>fast</i>-acting\
  \ poison,\" Alaeron went on, crouched in the tunnel, watching the opening at the\
  \ top. \"But it's not the slowest, either.\"</p> \n   <p>\"What poison? There were\
  \ no poison traps here.\"</p> \n   <p>\"That 'potion' I gave you. It was a toxin,\
  \ of course. That's why it didn't allow you to see in the dark. That's not what\
  \ it's meant to do. It's meant to kill.\"</p> \n   <p>Rodrick snorted. \"A sad attempt\
  \ at a bluff. You drank from the same vial.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Yes, and after we came\
  \ down into the dark, I also drank the antidote, along with a real potion of night\
  \ vision.\"</p> \n   <p>\"You lie,\" Rodrick said, but there was just a hint of\
  \ doubt. \"Why would you poison me? We were working well together, you said so yourself.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"I decided to poison you the moment you murdered that poor huldra\
  \ girl,\" Alaeron said. \"You were clearly dangerous, and needed to be stopped.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"Listen, you can't trick me, I'm a <i>trickster</i>, I—\"</p> \n \
  \  <p>\"The first symptoms are fairly subtle,\" Alaeron said, allowing his voice\
  \ to take on a lecturing, pedantic tone. \"Slight tremors in the hands and lips.\
  \ A sensation of cold in the hands and feet, though for some, the hands and feet\
  \ sweat instead. Racing thoughts, and difficulty concentrating. Some nausea. The\
  \ need to urinate. An unusually rapid heartbeat.\"</p> \n   <p>Alaeron was experiencing\
  \ most of those symptoms himself—understandably, as they were the effects of stress\
  \ and physical exertion—and it was a fair bet that Rodrick would be feeling them,\
  \ too.</p> \n   <p>\"I suppose this is where you tell me that if I race back to\
  \ my horse and up to the retreat, a dip in the healing waters will cure me?\" Rodrick\
  \ said.</p> \n   <p>\"Oh, no. You'd be dead long before you make it that far. Possibly\
  \ before you reached your horse. I'll just wait you out, I think. It's quite cozy\
  \ here, in a rabbit-in-a-burrow sort of way.\"</p> \n   <p>\"All right. Say I believe\
  \ you. What do you want in exchange for the antidote?\"</p> \n   <p>Alaeron considered.\
  \ \"Nothing. I can't say your death would bother me overmuch. I'm not a murderer,\
  \ but at this point the poisoning could be construed as self-defense, albeit a bit...\
  \ retroactive.\"</p> \n   <p>\"I can come down there and kill you and <i>take</i>\
  \ the antidote.\"</p> \n   <p>\"You're welcome to drink from every vial in my pack,\"\
  \ Alaeron said. \"The antidote is in one of them. Though none of the vials are too\
  \ clearly marked—I use an organizational system of my own devising.\" Alaeron felt\
  \ in his pack until his fingers touched a vial with the shape of a spiral cut into\
  \ the cork stopper. He took that silently from his pack, opened it, and took a sip.\
  \ The extract made his tongue tingle, and his heart immediately began to race even\
  \ faster. His senses grew sharper, every root and speck of dirt in the tunnel appearing\
  \ in crystal clarity, almost seeming to vibrate. </p> \n   <p>Rodrick came sliding\
  \ down the tunnel, a dagger in each hand, and tumbled into Alaeron, bowling him\
  \ over. The stopped halfway down the slope, having rolled sideways in the narrow\
  \ space. Alaeron's head pointed downward, with Rodrick on top of him, one knife\
  \ to Alaeron's throat, and the point of the other near his belly.</p> \n   <p>\"\
  I am faster and more agile than any mixer of potions, alchemist.\" Rodrick’s face,\
  \ rendered in black and white and shades of gray by Alaeron's altered eyes, was\
  \ sweaty and smeared with dirt. \"You will give me the antidote, or I will slice\
  \ open your belly and leave you for the linnorm—I'm sure the stink of your entrails\
  \ will wake him just as well as the scent of frying bacon wakes me.\"</p> \n   <p>\"\
  I find your argument compelling,\" Alaeron said, trying hard not to talk as fast\
  \ as he wanted to. His muscles thrummed with excess energy, like wires under tension.\
  \ The potion he'd taken was a powerful stimulant, one he used to fuel days-long\
  \ sessions in the lab, conducting his researches. \"If you'll climb off me, and\
  \ let me get my pack...\"</p> \n   <p>Rodrick rolled aside but kept the knife near\
  \ Alaeron's belly as the alchemist sat up. Alaeron felt in the pack and withdrew\
  \ a small metal flask, one of the few potions he'd brewed that would work on people\
  \ other than himself. \"Here you are.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Ha.\" Rodrick wiggled the\
  \ dagger, making Alaeron wince. \"Drink from it yourself first.\"</p> \n   <p>\"\
  The problem among modern adventurers,\" he said, \"is a lamentable lack of trust.\"\
  \ He took a swig from the potion. </p> \n   <p>\"Now give me your pack,\" Rodrick\
  \ said, \"so you can't drink <i>another</i> antidote, hmm?\"</p> \n   <p>\"No trust\
  \ at all.\" Alaeron slipped out of his pack and handed it over. </p> \n   <p>Rodrick\
  \ shoved the pack up the tunnel behind him, then plucked the flask from Alaeron's\
  \ hand. He took a drink. \"Huh. This tastes like...\"</p> \n   <p>\"Lavender, mainly,\"\
  \ Alaeron said. \"Which doesn't taste as good as it smells.\"</p> \n   <p>Rodrick\
  \ yawned, then looked alarmed. \"What? What have you...\" His eyes drooped, and\
  \ he slumped over, cheek pressed against the dirt of the tunnel floor, knives falling\
  \ from his hands. </p> \n   <p>The sleeping potion would keep him deeply unconscious\
  \ for a couple of hours, at least. Alaeron's sip of the potion had acted to counteract\
  \ the powerful stimulant he'd ingested earlier, with the result that he was now\
  \ just a little bit sleepy, instead of dead to the world.</p> \n   <p>He listened\
  \ hard, but heard no sound of stirring from the linnorm's chamber. Alaeron searched\
  \ Rodrick—the man had an <i>astonishing</i> quantity of knives hidden about his\
  \ person—and helped himself to all the smaller weapons, as well as Rodrick’s coin\
  \ purse, adding them to his own pack. </p> \n   <p>He considered how nasty he wanted\
  \ to be. He could cut the man's throat—but Alaeron had never killed a man in cold\
  \ blood before, and didn't savor the prospect. A time-delay bomb placed near the\
  \ linnorm's chamber would give Alaeron time to get away, and serve to wake the beast,\
  \ which was another way to take care of Rodrick—but that was still murder, just\
  \ more indirectly, and the linnorm would certainly rise from the earth, lay waste\
  \ to the countryside, and so on. Better to let sleeping wyrms lie.</p> \n   <p>That\
  \ went for Rodrick, too. The thief didn't even know Alaeron's name, and had only\
  \ seen his face in flickering torchlight. The odds were good they would never meet\
  \ again, and the alchemist could take steps to improve those odds.</p> \n   <p>Alaeron\
  \ settled for stealing Rodrick's boots, tying the man's ankles and wrists with the\
  \ laces, and climbing back out of the tunnel as silently as possible. In the upper\
  \ chamber, he collected the jewels and gold the linnorm had left behind. There was\
  \ enough to buy him another night at the retreat, and give him another opportunity\
  \ to steal a sample of the waters... but Rodrick would wake up eventually, and Alaeron\
  \ would be better off leaving the vicinity before then. </p> \n   <p>He considered\
  \ Uncle Brant's armor, but the prospect of taking it off the skeleton and then dragging\
  \ it out of the tomb was both unpleasant and daunting, as sleepy as Alaeron was.\
  \ He doused the torches and took the lantern with him, down the branching corridors,\
  \ up toward the surface world's light. When he came upon the dead huldra, he cut\
  \ a bit of her hair, and took a few scrapings of the bark from her hollow interior,\
  \ for later study—the remains of the fey were hard to come by, and could be powerful\
  \ reagents. He did his best not to get any of Simeon on his shoe when he passed\
  \ into the entry chamber. </p> \n   <div class=\"blurb360\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Linnorm.jpg\"\

  0\"></a>\n    <br> Best to let sleeping linnorms lie.\n   </div> \n   <p>Alaeron\
  \ emerged, blinking, into the late afternoon light. It was nearly dusk. He shouldered\
  \ the door to the barrow closed, and though it didn't magically seal, it would,\
  \ at least, keep passers-by from wandering in. He paused beside a nearby tree, chipped\
  \ some of the bark away to reveal white wood, and carved the words \"Beware the\
  \ linnorm.\" There. That was the best he could do. Not that most graverobbers were\
  \ terribly literate. </p> \n   <p>He stole Simeon and Rodrick's saddlebags and slapped\
  \ the horses to send them running away, though he left a waterskin for Rodrick at\
  \ the base of a tree—he wasn't a monster, and the gesture might mollify the thief's\
  \ rage. Alaeron saddled his own horse and made his way south through the hills,\
  \ heading in the general direction of Almas.</p> \n   <p>As night fell, he saw a\
  \ campfire, and took a chance on introducing himself. The men around the fire greeted\
  \ him warmly enough when he offered to share the fruit and dried meat he'd taken\
  \ from the stolen saddlebags.</p> \n   <p>They were a motley lot of adventurers,\
  \ a grizzled bearded veteran, a boy barely old enough to shave, a pale girl with\
  \ tattooed cheeks reading by firelight, and a surly half-orc lurking off in the\
  \ trees by himself. \"Where are you bound?\" Alaeron asked.</p> \n   <p>\"The boy\
  \ and I are going north,\" the old veteran said. \"To the land of the linnorm kings.\
  \ My old homeland.\"</p> \n   <p>\"We're going to slay a linnorm,\" the boy said\
  \ brightly. \"Snowbeard says all you have to do to become a king there is carry\
  \ the head of a linnorm through the gates of a village. His brother's a king, he\
  \ stole the head of the monster Snowbeard killed when they were young, and—\"</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"He doesn't need to know our history,\" Snowbeard snapped. </p> \n  \
  \ <p>Oh, my, Alaeron thought. He generally gave the gods little thought, but this\
  \ certainly seemed like some deity's idea of a good jest. Alaeron considered telling\
  \ Snowbeard there was a linnorm rather closer. But the practical difficulties of\
  \ transporting the head of a dead monster all those leagues to the land of snow\
  \ and ice would be hellish. Why, the stink alone, as the head began to rot... Better\
  \ to let them make their own way.</p> \n   <p>\"I'm thinking of going north myself,\"\
  \ Alaeron said. \"Farther east, though, to Numeria. I hear there are amazing relics\
  \ just scattered all over the ground up there, amid the wreckage of some ancient\
  \ cataclysm.\" He would have to go home first for provisions, but he'd been pondering\
  \ a trip to Numeria's capital, Starfall, for a while, and it was even more tempting\
  \ now. The Black Sovereign's realm was an unlikely destination... which meant even\
  \ if Rodrick woke with a taste for vengeance, he wouldn't look for Alaeron there.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>The tattooed woman closed her book and looked up for the first time. \"\
  Numeria? I am bound in that direction as well, though my destination is the Worldwound.\
  \ We will likely travel the same route. Would you care to journey together?\"</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Alaeron hesitated. She was comely under those tattoos, and clearly quite\
  \ intelligent, but... \"I think, for now, I would prefer to pursue my quest with\
  \ no company other than my own. I fear I am a... poor adventuring companion.\"</p>\
  \ \n   <p>The woman shrugged and went back to her book. </p> \n   <p>Alaeron leaned\
  \ back against a fallen log and looked up, watching the smoke from the fire drift\
  \ up toward the stars, thinking of monsters, and holes in the earth, and the open\
  \ sky.</p> \n   <p><b>Coming Next Week:</b> A glimpse into the life of an elite\
