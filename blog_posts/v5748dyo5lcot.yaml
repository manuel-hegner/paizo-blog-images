  \ class=\"PTales\"></div></a> \n   <h1>The Box</h1> \n   <p>by Bill Ward</p> \n\
  \   <h2>Chapter One: Win Some, Lose Some</h2> \n   <p>Kostin talked as he circled\
  \ the box, a cube of black wood a forearm's length across resting on a table at\
  \ the center of the junk-cluttered attic room. The afternoon's heist had come off\
  \ without a hitch, and Kostin was still basking in the giddy afterglow of his success;\
  \ his mind and mouth, as the old Varisian saying went, were determined to outrace\
  \ one another. It had taken every scrap of will he possessed to leave the box alone\
  \ until his friends had arrived that evening. Kostin knew that the real danger with\
  \ a score like this was not so much in the stealing of the thing, but in the opening.\
  \ Whatever this box was—and by extension whatever was in it—was <i>special</i>.\
  \ The exact kind of special that made fortunes and got people killed in equal measure.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"So... to the box itself.\" Kostin, having finished his retelling of\
  \ the day's con, got on with the business of the evening. \"The wood is clearly\
  \ onyx bark from the Mwangi Expanse, spot-lacquered in the Vudran style. The inlay\
  \ is most likely the work of a Chelish silversmith, and the locking mechanism—at\
  \ least what is visible so far—is almost certainly of dwarven make. Agree?\"</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Not even close.\" Aeventius Reatés, scion of one of Magnimar's oldest—\
  and now most impoverished—families, looked up from his scrutiny of the box to fix\
  \ his glowing eyes on Kostin. \"But it is wizard-locked. And why exactly is... <i>she</i>...\
  \ here for this?\"</p> \n   <p>\"The name's Taldara, Aeventius,\" The third member\
  \ of the group was a tall blonde leaning uncomfortably on the edge of a wobble-legged\
  \ Galtan dining table. \"Though I suppose feigning ignorance of my name is just\
  \ your way of making me feel welcome after all these years.\" Taldara paused to\
  \ scratch the head of the sleek badger draping her right shoulder and shifted her\
  \ gaze toward Kostin. \"As far as why I'm here, well, our mutual friend lied to\
  \ me.\"</p> \n   <div class=\"blurb360\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Kostin.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Kostin_360.jpeg\" border=\"0\"\
  ></a>\n    <br> Most Chelaxians assume every Varisian’s a thief. In Kostin’s case,\
  \ they’d be right.\n   </div> \n   <p>Spreading both hands in a gesture of pleading\
  \ innocence, Kostin deployed his most charming half-smile. \"We could still be looking\
  \ at a major find, Tal. Besides, isn't this more fun than sketching the Irespan\
  \ all day? You should be flattered I trust you with something like this.\"</p> \n\
  \   <p>Aeventius, the bluish glow of the detection spell fading from his eyes, pushed\
  \ his way irritably past Kostin to examine the box from another angle. Tall and\
  \ sharp-featured, with jet-black hair sweeping back from a high forehead, the wizard\
  \ looked every bit the full-blood Azlanti he claimed to be. \"There are precautions\
  \ we must take before...\" Aeventius trailed off and cocked his head, listening.\
  \ \"Someone at your door.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Flattered!\" Ignoring the wizard, Taldara\
  \ shot to her feet and took a step toward Kostin. She wore her fair hair back in\
  \ a single, thick braid that exposed the pronounced tips of her ears, lending her\
  \ a somewhat severe aspect. \"You told me exactly what you knew would get me here.\
  \ And now it seems that, in addition to this having nothing to do with Thassilonian\
  \ artifacts, we've come to help you appraise <i>stolen</i> goods.\"</p> \n   <p><i>Caught\
  \ with your hand in another man's pocket</i>, Kostin thought. How is it he could\
  \ coolly lie his way into Dockway's cargo impound with little more than an inexpertly\
  \ forged writ of seizure and a cocky swagger, but this girl so completely disarmed\
  \ him? Woman now, he corrected. It had after all been twelve years, long enough\
  \ for even someone with Taldara's half-elven heritage to leave childhood completely\
  \ behind and grow into someone new, a stranger.</p> \n   <p>And stranger she was,\
  \ returning to Magnimar a world traveler, scholar, and newly minted Pathfinder—\
  far more than Kostin had managed to do for himself. No, Kostin Dalakcz had stayed\
  \ behind—stayed behind and become exactly what the predominantly Chelish population\
  \ of his city suspected all Varisians of being: a thief.</p> \n   <p>At least he\
  \ didn't run a harrow parlor.</p> \n   <p>\"Would you answer that damn door already?\"\
  \ Aeventius spoke without looking up from the box, and Kostin, noting the banging\
  \ downstairs for the first time, tore his attention away from Taldara. No, he did\
  \ not run a harrow parlor, but he did run that most ubiquitous of Varisian institutions:\
  \ the odds and ends shop. Among the citified Varisians who, like Kostin's father,\
  \ had given up their wandering to settle throughout the Shore District of Magnimar,\
  \ the small import-export emporiums like Dalakcz Durables of Callowcaulk Street,\
  \ Beacon's Point, were a profitable link between the inland caravans and the sea.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Of course, such businesses had proven even more lucrative as fronts and\
  \ fences for stolen goods, and if Kostin's father could see what had become of his\
  \ once above-board shop, he would no doubt spit curses enough to make an Ulfen blush.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>The banging three stories down had changed—it now sounded more like someone\
  \ trying to smash down the door. Kostin could feel the vibrations through the floor\
  \ with each blow.</p> \n   <p>\"Probably some dumb drunk stevedore looking for the\
  \ Whale's Belly,\" he growled, kicking his way toward the street-side windows through\
  \ the detritus of the loft; a clutter of unsaleable items like a litterbin for all\
  \ Golarion. Forcing open a window, Kostin leaned out. \"Two blocks shoreward, you\
  \ souse!\"</p> \n   <p>The pane above him shattered before Kostin even registered\
  \ the crossbow-armed thugs arrayed in the street below. He ducked back inside, collapsing\
  \ to the floor and upsetting a standing shelf full of brass fittings and tarnished\
  \ silverware. Another thunk drew his attention to the ceiling, where a second crossbow\
  \ bolt buried itself a hand's breadth away from the first.</p> \n   <p>There must\
  \ have been fifteen of them out there, that damn Shoanti gutter-gang bristling with\
  \ weapons and painted for war.</p> \n   <p>Downstairs the door crashed in with a\
  \ splintering final boom.</p> \n   <p>\"New friends, or old?\" Aeventius asked,\
  \ stretching to his full height and cracking his knuckles. Taldara had rushed to\
  \ Kostin's side, checking him for injuries. Her badger hissed eerily, bristling\
  \ in agitation as it clung to her shoulder with curled nails the length of a man's\
  \ fingers. Until that moment it had seemed a mere cute pet to Kostin, with its black-and-white\
  \ face and bumbling demeanor—now it seemed about as cuddly as a war dog.</p> \n\
  \   <p>Kostin scrambled to his feet, glass crunching beneath his boots. The sounds\
  \ of destruction rose muffled from the first floor. The shop was being trashed.\
  \ \"New,\" he said in answer to the wizard's question. \"A dozen or more. But I\
  \ never crossed any Shoanti. \"</p> \n   <p>Aeventius tapped a finger on the polished\
  \ lid of the stolen box. \"I do not believe in coincidence.\"</p> \n   <p>Kostin\
  \ shook his head as he strapped on his sword belt. It sounded as if a cavalry squadron\
  \ maneuvered downstairs—or a single, epileptic giant flailed about in destructive\
  \ seizure. \"Not these guys. Small-time thugs running low-level stuff between the\
  \ Point and Rag's End. A real headache for the Sczarni, but not someone like me.\
  \ If anyone would be looking for the box, I'd expect the Scales, or one of the Shadow\
  \ bosses. These guys are street trash.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Sounds like the 'street trash'\
  \ have just reached the second floor,\" Taldara said, drawing a long knife from\
  \ beneath her jacket.</p> \n   <p>Aeventius, stooping low under the slanted ceiling\
  \ at the far end of the room, was already peering out the alley-side windows. \"\
  Seems clear. Difficult to tell.\"</p> \n   <p>Leaning with one ear pressed against\
  \ the attic's only door and listening to the intruders' chaos, Kostin uttered a\
  \ string of fluent Varisian under his breath. \"We could fight...\"</p> \n   <p>\"\
  Don’t be a fool,\" countered the wizard.</p> \n   <p>\"It's my home, Aevy,\" said\
  \ Kostin.</p> \n   <p>\"It is our lives I am thinking of,\" Aeventius said, raising\
  \ the window and once again inspecting the street. \"And I told you never to call\
  \ me that.\"</p> \n   <p>\"He's right,\" Taldara agreed. Pulling Kostin away from\
  \ the door, she began to drag the heavy Galtan dining table to bar the passage.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Desna laughs,\" Kostin hissed between clenched teeth before joining\
  \ Taldara with the table. Shouts and the sounds of rampage had grown closer, now\
  \ coming from the stairwell.</p> \n   <p>Behind them Aeventius was intoning a spell,\
  \ uttering the strange language of magic as if he had been born to it. Kostin turned\
  \ in time to see the flash of the wizard's ring, and the unstoppering of a phial\
  \ in his other hand. Bringing the phial to his lips, Aeventius sucked up the contents\
  \ with a sharp intake of breath. Kostin knew from experience that the wizard had\
  \ just eaten a live spider, and judging from the grimace on his friend's face it\
  \ had probably been a large one.</p> \n   <p>\"Come,\" Aeventius said, before vaulting\
  \ out of the window with the practiced ease of an acrobat.</p> \n   <p>\"You next,\"\
  \ Kostin said to Taldara. Behind them, the door boomed as if hit with a siege ram.\
  \ \"Go up.\" She did not argue, following Aeventius through the window with more\
  \ composure than Kostin would have ever expected. He scooped up the mage-locked\
  \ box—was it really the cause of all this?—and climbed through the window just as\
  \ the attic door splintered from its hinges, toppling the primitive barricade. The\
  \ howls of the Shoanti spilled out into the night after him.</p> \n   <p>The edge\
  \ of the roof was within easy reach, and Kostin hoisted himself up one-handed, with\
  \ Taldara's aid. From the vantage of the slate roof he could see his building—of\
  \ which his rented storefront and apartments comprised but a tenth—stretching away\
  \ to north and south. To his right, across the alley, the old five-story Rope Works\
  \ building blocked their sight of the landward portion of the city, but the convoluted\
  \ tangle of warehouses, dockyards, taverns, and tenements that comprised the shoreward\
  \ view dazzled with alternating patches of light and dark.</p> \n   <p>The warm\
  \ flicker of torches below stole his attention—some of the Shoanti, shouting and\
  \ whooping like a pack of wild dogs, had run around into the alley to block any\
  \ escape.</p> \n   <p>Breathing deeply of the cool, sea-tanged night air, Kostin\
  \ struck out northward, Aeventius and Taldara at his heels. Before him loomed the\
  \ dark shape of the Rope Works as it veered sharply shoreward just at the end of\
  \ his block. The roof upon which they ran was a black wedge against the lights of\
  \ the Shore, as the lower city was called. Just above was another dark band, the\
  \ Seacleft, the great cliff that bisected Magnimar, atop which blazed the lights\
  \ of the Summit, the upper city, a bright knife-edge glow like a barrier between\
  \ the commoners of the Shore and the glittering heavens above.</p> \n   <p>A snarling\
  \ yell announced that the Shoanti had followed them onto the roof.</p>\n   <p>\"\
  I will go first, then you can throw over the box,\" Aeventius said as they neared\
  \ the narrowest space between the tenement and the Rope Works. They had practiced\
  \ this escape route years ago, the leap over to the Rope Works and the quick climb\
  \ to its abandoned top floor, but never had Kostin's heart been hammering in his\
  \ chest like this, or his limbs trembling.</p> \n   <p>Unseen in the darkness, crossbow\
  \ bolts whispered past.</p> \n   <p>Aeventius jumped out over the alley and struck\
  \ the stone face of the Rope Works hard, sliding a little before finding purchase\
  \ on a scrollwork ledge. He twisted his body, clinging to the building with one\
  \ hand, and Kostin tossed the box over so that it hit the wizard square in the chest.\
  \ Aeventius clutched it reflexively, holding tight.</p> \n   <p>Kostin turned to\
  \ Taldara, intending to give a few words of encouragement, but the spry half-elf\
  \ was already moving, leaping between buildings and flattening herself against the\
  \ stones a bit higher up than Aeventius. Clearly she had been living a more exciting\
  \ life than one spent writing travelogues and sketching artifacts since last he\
  \ saw her—he only hoped he would get a chance to hear about it one day.</p> \n \
  \  <p>With a wild shout, Kostin followed his friends across the gap, catching the\
  \ ledge with a shock to knock his breath out.</p> \n   <p>Aeventius scrambled past\
  \ him, going upward, pausing only to hand over the chest of black wood that was\
  \ the source of all their trouble.</p> \n   <p>To his left, a bolt cracked against\
  \ the wall. Kostin began to climb as best he could with one hand, waiting for the\
  \ shout from Aeventius that meant the wizard was ready for him to toss the box upward.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>The smack of flesh and iron below and to his right drew Kostin's attention.\
  \ There in the dark, one of the Shoanti—exposed skin painted in ochre and ash—wrestled\
  \ with Taldara. Her badger growled and bit at the thug, slipping from her shoulder\
  \ and down to the stone ledge upon which she and the Shoanti balanced.</p> \n  \
  \ <p>Taldara ducked to scoop the creature up, leaving herself defenseless.</p> \n\
  \   <p>Kostin saw the gleam of the knife in the dark above her, poised to strike.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Toss it up now!\" came Aeventius's shout from above.</p> \n   <p>Kostin\
  \ cocked his arm back and threw, not upward at the wizard, but hard down and into\
  \ the face of the attacking Shoanti. The sharp crack of impact and a gargled yell\
  \ preceded the man's fall. Man and box both plummeted into the torch-lit alleyway,\
  \ down among the swarming Shoanti pack.</p> \n   <p>Their howls of victory rose\
  \ up in the same instant that the first tongues of flame sprang from the windows\
  \ of Kostin's home.</p> \n   <p><b>Coming Next Week:</b> The secret lives of the\
