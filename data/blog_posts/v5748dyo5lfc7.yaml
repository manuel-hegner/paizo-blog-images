  \ are inextricably linked for me, so I suppose it's little wonder that I ended up\
  \ authoring game books. I've been playing various roleplaying games since junior\
  \ high, starting with Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and I soon saw that one of\
  \ the biggest differences between a good and a passable GM is the ability to spin\
  \ an exciting yarn. Gamemastering isn't just about knowing the rules—to be honest,\
  \ I've always been a little loose in that regard. I think it's more important to\
  \ be able to vividly describe things and to impart a sense of forward momentum—\
  to know when to run with the die roll, and when to fudge things.</span></p> \n \
  \    <p>For instance, I believe that if the players come up with a clever way around\
  \ a challenge, it's more rewarding to let them succeed rather than to insist they\
  \ solve the challenge as scripted. If a monster still has ten hit points after the\
  \ characters ran some cinematic tactic against it, I usually tell my players they've\
  \ finished the thing off. It feels a lot more satisfying than forcing them to hack\
  \ it a few more times.</p> \n     <p>I talk a lot about my literary influences,\
  \ among them Harold Lamb, Leigh Brackett, Robert E. Howard, Fritz Leiber, and Roger\
  \ Zelazny. I learned a lot about storytelling from these and other writers. But\
  \ I gained a lot of practical storytelling experience from the games I've run. The\
  \ villainous plots of numerous Dabir and Asim short stories, not to mention the\
  \ central conceit of my novel The Desert of Souls, were adapted from adventures\
  \ I created on my homebrew game world.</p> \n     <p>Oddly enough, the events from\
  \ both <a href=\"/products/btpy8iqp\"><i>Plague of Shadows</i></a> and <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy8you\"><i>Stalking the Beast</i></a> don't come from any games I've\
  \ run—not a single scene! A lot of the material in my own campaign world is suffused\
  \ with elements of gothic horror, and while there's certainly horror and suspense\
  \ in the Elyana books, in neither one have I played up on the gothic (I haven't\
  \ ever sent her to fog-shrouded Ustalav). Elyana herself has some of the attributes\
  \ of my wife's usual characters—she's oriented to the wild and is quite intelligent—\
  but Elyana herself is more grim and jaundiced than any player characters in my group.\
  \ I think we like to play a lighter game—not a jokey one, but a game where the characters\
  \ aren't weighed down by the kind of troubles we get too much of in the real world.\
  \ Elyana and Drelm have some baggage. </p> \n     <p>And that, I think, is something\
  \ different between storytelling with a group and storytelling in a novel. When\
  \ you're gaming, it can wear a person down to play a character haunted by their\
  \ past and worried about the prejudices of his or her fellow creatures—at least\
  \ if you have the sort of traumatic jobs some of my players have. In fiction, though,\
  \ those complexities round out protagonists and make them a lot more compelling.</p>\
