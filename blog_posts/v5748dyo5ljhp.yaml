  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">We interrupt\
  \ your regularly scheduled Adventure Card Game blog to announce some exciting news!\
  \ Last September, the Pathfinder Society unveiled a <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lj4b?Pathfinder-Society-Retail-Incentive-Program\"\
  >Retail Incentive Program</a> for the Roleplaying Guild, aimed at rewarding purchases\
  \ made at Friendly Local Game Stores or other retail establishments that offer Pathfinder\
  \ Society space for games. At the time, we indicated that we'd look at options for\
  \ an Adventure Card Guild version. The RPG Incentive Program concludes its fourth\
  \ month in a few days, and it has proven well-received by players and stores alike.\
  \ We are now pleased to announce the launch of the Adventure Card Guild version\
  \ of the Retail Incentive Program.</p> \n    <p>Constructive feedback is vital to\
  \ programs like this, in that it allows us to evaluate our offerings and make changes\
  \ where necessary. Any feedback may be sent to <a href=\"mailto:pathfindersociety@paizo.com\"\
  >pathfindersociety@paizo.com</a> or posted in the discussion thread below.</p> \n\
  \    <blockquote> \n     <h2>Adventure Card Guild Retail Incentive Program</h2>\
  \ \n     <p><i>This program is designed to encourage players to reward retail locations\
  \ that are providing space for Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild players.\
  \ Locations utilizing the program should advertise its presence to their clientele.\
  \ We realize that each location is unique, and has an overriding right to determine\
  \ what is best for their business, so participation in this program is not mandatory.\
  \ In cases where the specifics of the program don't align well with the retail's\
  \ procedures (for example, if they don't provide receipts, or they run daily tabs),\
  \ the event coordinator should work with the retailer to best approximate the intent\
  \ of the policy.</i></p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p>Game stores and other retail\
  \ locations are an important part of the Pathfinder Society community, and it's\
  \ important to support them so that they continue to provide support for Pathfinder\
  \ Society play. Under this program, players can redeem receipts in exchange for\
  \ modest benefits for the entire party.</p> \n      <p>Redeeming a receipt simply\
  \ involves showing it to the event coordinator, who marks the receipt to denote\
  \ that it was used. A player can only use a receipt in this way on the day of the\
  \ purchase, and only for an event at that venue. The receipt need not include Paizo\
  \ productsâ€”any products the venue sells count as qualifying purchases. Players cannot\
  \ acquire or redeem receipts during their own turn or during any player's encounter;\
  \ otherwise, players can acquire and redeem receipts during play only when doing\
  \ so does not significantly disrupt gameplay.</p> \n      <p>If the combined value\
  \ of the receipts redeemed by players at the table exceeds $10, all of the characters\
  \ at the table receive the ongoing benefit described below, and each character chooses\
  \ one of the single-use benefits described below. If the combined value exceeds\
  \ $50, you may use the enhanced version of the applicable benefits instead. (In\
  \ countries that use currencies other than US Dollars, use approximate equivalents\
  \ of $10 and $50; don't worry too much about figuring out the exact exchange rate.)\
  \ The ongoing benefit lasts for up to 5 hours, and each character may use their\
  \ chosen one-time benefit once in each scenario played during those 5 hours. Characters\
  \ can only receive these benefits once during any 5-hour block.</p> \n      <h3>Ongoing\
  \ Benefit (for all characters)</h3> \n      <blockquote> \n       <p><b>Harder to\
  \ Kill:</b> When you reset your hand, you may treat your hand size as 1 lower.<br>\
  \ <i>Enhanced Version:</i> When you reset your hand, you may treat your hand size\
  \ as 2 lower.</p> \n      </blockquote> \n      <h3>Single-Use Benefits (each character\
  \ chooses one)</h3> \n      <blockquote> \n       <p><b>Cheaper Boons:</b> Add 1d6\
  \ to your check to acquire.<br> <i>Enhanced Version:</i> Add 2d6 to your check to\
  \ acquire.</p> \n       <p><b>Recover from Wounds:</b> Recharge a random card from\
  \ your discard pile.<br> <i>Enhanced Version:</i> Recharge 2 random cards from your\
  \ discard pile.</p> \n       <p><b>Bonus Wealth:</b> Draw 1 card.<br> <i>Enhanced\
  \ Version:</i> Draw 2 cards.</p> \n      </blockquote> \n      <p>The benefits gained\
  \ from this program are in addition to benefits such as the Accessory Perks referred\
  \ to in the <a href=\"/products/btpy98no\"><em>Pathfinder Society Adventure Card\
  \ Guild Guide</em></a> or on Pathfinder Society <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/rerolls\"\
  >Rerolls</a> page on paizo.com.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n    </blockquote> \n\
  \    <p>The <a href=\"/products/btpy98no\"><em>Adventure Card Guild Guide</em></a>\
  \ and the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/policies\">Policies</a> page have been updated\
  \ to include this program information.</p> \n    <p>Thanks to Vic, Mike, Keith,\
  \ and the rest of the Sharks for letting me guest blog and share the news with our\
  \ Adventure Card Game players. I'm excited about the program and cannot wait to\
  \ hear stories from the field!</p> \n    <p>May you draw only boons!</p> \n    <p>Tonya\
