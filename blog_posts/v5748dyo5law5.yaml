  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Friday, March 19, 2010</p> \n   <p>Hello!</p> \n   <p>This\
  \ is the official call for volunteer GMs and assistants to help Paizo Publishing\
  \ run events at PaizoCon 2010 and Gen Con 2010. (If you're looking for the Origins\
  \ Game Fair volunteer thread, click <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/pathfinder/pathfinderSociety/grandLodge/callForPathfinderSocietyGMsOrigins2010June2427\"\
  >here</a>.)</p> \n   <h1>Paizo Con 2010</h1> \n   <p>For Paizo Con 2010, I need\
  \ a minimum of 20 volunteer GMs for Pathfinder Society Organized Play and I'll keep\
  \ taking volunteers until the slots are full! Below you will find the reward structure\
  \ for volunteering at PaizoCon 2010 as well as the events and slots for which I\
  \ need volunteer GMs. I also need 2 volunteer assistants for the show—these folks\
  \ will not GM, but will instead run Pathfinder Society HQ and will be my go-to guys\
  \ and gals for all things Pathfinder Society. Volunteers must volunteer for a minimum\
  \ of 2 slots and the volunteer assistants are volunteering to split time at HQ for\
  \ the entire show. PaizoCon 2010 volunteer GMs and volunteer assistants receive\
  \ the following:</p> \n   <p>(Volunteer GMs) A $10 per slot credit voucher for the\
  \ Paizo sales area<br> (Volunteer Assistants) A $15 per slot credit voucher for\
  \ the Paizo sales area</p> \n   <p>All PaizoCon 2010 volunteers can email me: <a\
  \ href=\"mailto:josh@paizo.com?subject=PaizoCon Volunteer\">josh@paizo.com</a> with\
  \ the subject line <b>PaizoCon Volunteer</b>. I can only take volunteers for Paizo\
  \ Con who have <a href=\"/store/paizo/paizocon/v5748btpy8b57\">purchased a badge\
  \ to the show</a>.</p> \n   <p>Keep in mind that you're volunteering for a slot,\
  \ not a specific event. I'll assign people to events inside the slot they've volunteered\
  \ for and I won't take requests.</p> \n   <p>Volunteer Assistants: <br><b>FULL!\
  \ No more needed</b></p> \n   <p>Slot 1: Friday 12 P.M. to 5:00 P.M.<br> <b>Need</b>:\

  \ to 1 P.M.<br> <b>Need</b>: 1 volunteer GM</p> \n   <h1>Gen Con 2010</h1> For Gen\
  \ Con 2010, I need a minimum of 50 volunteer GMs and I'll keep taking volunteer\
  \ GMs until the slots are filled! I also need 3 Volunteer Assistants for the show—\
  these folks will not GM, but will instead run Pathfinder Society HQ and will be\
  \ my go-to guys and gals for all things Pathfinder Society. This year I'm also seeking\
  \ 4 \"booth volunteers.\" These folks must be highly knowledgeable about all of\
  \ Paizo's products lines, must be well kept, clean, and professional, and must be\
  \ able to stand and move for up to 6 hours at a time. Booth volunteers will work\
  \ the Paizo booth sales floor, answer questions, and let Paizo employees know when\
  \ product needs to be restocked. Booth volunteers will not work the register and\
  \ will not have access to the back area of the booth. Below you will find the reward\
  \ structure for volunteering at Gen Con 2010 as well as the events and slots for\
  \ which I need volunteer GMs and booth volunteers.\n   <p></p> \n   <p>Keep in mind\
  \ that you're volunteering for a slot, not a specific event. I'll assign people\
  \ to events inside the slot they've volunteered for and I won't take requests.</p>\
  \ \n   <p><b>Volunteer Tiers and Rewards</b></p> \n   <p><b>Volunteer Assistant</b><br>\

  \ No more needed.</p> \n   <p><b>Tier 1 GM Volunteers</b><br> Tier 1 GM volunteers\
  \ are my workhorse, every day GMs. They are invaluable to making the show a success!\
  \ Tier 1 GMs must select and volunteer for a MINIMUM of 8 slots. Tier 1 GMs may\
  \ feel free to volunteer for more than 8 slots if they so desire. I only have room\
  \ for 24 Tier 1 GM volunteers so don't delay in volunteering for this tier. Volunteers\
  \ will be chosen on a first-come, first-served basis, though I reserve the right\
  \ to select volunteers who have previously worked for Paizo over new volunteers.\
  \ Please do not volunteer for Tier 1 if you have any doubts that you won't be able\
  \ to attend the show. Tier 1 GMs receive:</p> \n   <p>A FREE 4-day Gen Con 2010\
  \ badge<br> A FREE 1/4 of a hotel room in the Marriott Downtown Indianapolis<br>\

  \ for volunteering for this tier are smaller, the majority of my volunteers will\
  \ come from Tier 2. Tier 2 GMs must volunteer for a MINIMUM of 4 slots. Tier 2 GMs\

  \ $10 per slot voucher for the Paizo booth<br> A FREE limited edition Paizo Publishing\
  \ Gen Con 2010 T-Shirt</p> \n   <p><b>Volunteering for One Slot</b><br> While we\
  \ will gladly accept anyone who wants to run just one slot during the show, there\
  \ are no rewards for doing so other than our thanks.</p> \n   <p><b>When Volunteering...</b><br>\
  \ Please be specific about what slot you are volunteering for. I will assign folks\
  \ to scenarios on an as-needed basis, so you really only need to tell me the slot(s)\
  \ you're volunteering for (since I won't take requests). I will update the needs\
  \ in the thread below as I receive volunteers, so you may look there to remain up\
  \ to date on where we still need help. Lastly, you must have a <a href=\"http://www.gencon.com\"\
  \ target=\"nofollow\">gencon.com</a> account and you must include your <a href=\"\
  http://www.gencon.com\" target=\"nofollow\">gencon.com</a> account # in your email\
  \ or I won't be able to get you a badge (obviously this is only for volunteers who\
  \ are volunteering for 4 or more slots).</p> \n   <p>Slot 1: Thursday 8 A.M. to\
