  \           </div>\n              <p itemprop=\"description\">You've created your\
  \ character. You've tasted that first bite of toil and heroics, earned your first\
  \ thousand Experience Points, and come back to town a hero. Is it time to hang up\
  \ the sword, sidle into the local tavern, and get free drinks for years in return\
  \ for spinning yarns of your youthful adventuring day?</p>\n              <p>Hell\
  \ no. It's time to level up your character so you can do it all again!</p>\n   \
  \           <p>This week we're going to examine how you advance your characters\
  \ in Pathfinder. We are going to start with your young fighter who resists the urge\
  \ to retire and sit on his laurels and instead decides that adventuring is his jam.\
  \ Let's start by advancing the hero of our story—a human (skilled) fighter, with\
  \ the nomad background. Let's call him Kaliban.</p>\n              <h2>First Steps</h2>\n\
  \              <p>Each time you gain a new level, there're a few things you're going\
  \ to want to do first. First, you're going to increase your level by one and subtract\
  \ 1,000 Experience Points (XP) for your XP total. Then you're going to increase\
  \ your Hit Points by the amount determined by class and then add your Constitution\
  \ modifier.</p>\n              <p>Kaliban is a fighter, so his Hit Points increase\
  \ by 10 + his Constitution bonus (let's say he has Con 14) so his total Hit Points\
  \ at 2nd level become 32.</p>\n              <p>Lastly, you're going to take a look\
  \ at your class progression table and apply any class features that aren't feat\
  \ choices, ability boosts, or skill increases. We'll take a closer look at that\
  \ later, at 3rd level when Kaliban gains the bravery class feature, but at 2nd level,\
  \ Kaliban gains a fighter feat and a skill feat as class features, so we are going\
  \ to move on to the next step.</p>\n              <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\

  \ feat, shield block. 2 | Fighter feat, skill feat. 3| Bravery, general feat, skill\
  \ increase.\" style=\"padding-bottom: 20px;\">\n              </div>\n         \
  \     <h2>Choose Your Feats</h2>\n              <p>In terms of pure role and effectiveness\
  \ oomph, choosing a new class feat is often the most exciting choice you can make\
  \ when advancing your character. First off, let's assume that during character creation\
  \ Kaliban had already taken Power Attack.</p>\n              <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n               <img src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190715-powerattack.jpg\"\
  \ alt=\"Power attack. Two actions. Feat 1. Fighter. Flourish. You unleash a particularly\
  \ powerful attack that clobbers your foe but leaves you a bit unsteady. Make a melee\
  \ Strike. This counts as two attacks when calculating your multiple attack penalty.\
  \ If this Strike hits, you deal an extra die of weapon damage. If you’re at least\
  \ 10th level, increase this to two extra dice, and if you’re at least 18th level,\
  \ increase it to three extra dice.\" style=\"padding-bottom: 20px;\">\n        \
  \      </div>\n              <p>Kaliban likes power. And Power Attack allows Kaliban\
  \ to deal even more damage with his favorite weapon—a maul. At 2nd level, he could\
  \ continue on this punishing path by taking the Brutish Shove fighter feat, which\
  \ allows him to throw his enemies around the battlefield.</p>\n              <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n               <img src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190715-brutishshove.jpg\"\
  \ alt=\"Brutish Shove. One action. Feat 2. Fighter. Press. Requirements: You are\
  \ wielding a two-handed melee weapon.  Description: Throwing your weight behind\
  \ your attack, you hit your opponent hard enough to make it stumble back. Make a\
  \ Strike with a two-handed melee weapon. If you have a target that is your size\
  \ or smaller, that creature is flat-footed until the end of your current turn, and\
  \ you can automatically Shove it, with the same benefits as the Shove action (including\
  \ the critical success effect, if your Strike was a critical hit). If you move to\
  \ follow the target, your movement doesn’t trigger reactions.  This Strike has the\
  \ following failure effect: The target becomes flat-footed until the end of your\
  \ current turn.\" style=\"padding-bottom: 20px;\">\n              </div>\n     \
  \         <p>This seems like the obvious choice, but let's imagine Kaliban is not\
  \ your typical fighter. He's a particularly smart fellow (Intelligence 14). Let's\
  \ also imagine that during his first adventure, he came across a frightfully competent\
  \ gnoll evoker who gave Kaliban and his companions a tough time of it. And during\
  \ that encounter, while taking the abuse that gnoll was dishing out, Kaliban wondered\
  \ what it would be like to mix martial prowess with that kind of arcane might. Lucky\
  \ for Kaliban, once he reaches 2nd level, the fighter has the opportunity to grow\
  \ in a different direction. He can choose to multiclass.</p>\n              <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n               <img src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190715-wizarddedication.jpg\"\
  \ alt=\"Wizard Dedication. Feat 2. Archetype. Dedication. Multiclass. Prerequisites:\
  \ Intelligence 14. Description: You cast spells like a wizard, gaining a spell book\
  \ with four common arcane cantrips of your choice. You gain the Cast a Spell activity.\
  \ You can prepare two cantrips each day from your spell book. You’re trained in\
  \ arcane spell attack rolls and spell DCs.Your key spell casting ability for wizard\
  \ archetype spells is Int, and they are arcane wizard spells. You become trained\
  \ in Arcana; if you were already trained in Arcana, you instead become trained in\
  \ a skill of your choice. Special: You can’t select another dedication feat until\
  \ you have gained two other feats from the wizard archetype.\" style=\"padding-bottom:\
  \ 20px;\">\n              </div>\n              <p>It's not a bad deal. A spellbook\
  \ with four cantrips, the ability to prepare two of them a day, and training in\
  \ Arcana strikes the fighter as more promising than just pushing around his enemies.\
  \ Some fighters might scoff at such dalliance, but Kaliban decides to go the fighter/wizard\
  \ route. Taking a quick look at the arcane cantrips, he chooses to scribble daze,\
  \ mage hand, shield, and telekinetic projectile in his spellbook. Most adventuring\
  \ days, he typically leans on shield and telekinetic projectile as his prepared\
  \ cantrips.</p>\n              <p>After picking his class feat, Kaliban picks a\
  \ skill feat. He has training in the following skills: Acrobatics, Arcana, Athletics,\
  \ Crafting, Desert Lore, Intimidation, Nature, Society, Stealth, and Survival, so\
  \ he has a lot of choices. But let's say Kaliban has become enamored with his brief\
  \ magical studies and chooses Arcane Sense.</p>\n              <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n               <img src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190715-arcanesense.jpg\"\
  \ alt=\"Arcane Sense. Feat 1. General. Skill. Prerequisites: trained in Arcana.\
  \ Description: Your study of magic allows you to instinctively sense its presence.\
  \ You can cast 1st-level *detect magic* at will as an arcane innate spell. If you’\
  re a master in Arcana, the spell is heightened to 3rd level; if you’re legendary,\
  \ it is heightened to 4th level.\" style=\"padding-bottom: 20px;\">\n          \
  \    </div>\n              <p>This way Kaliban can always be on the lookout for\
  \ more magic to supplement his spellbook, equipment, and his split aspirations.</p>\n\
  \              <p>With his skill feat chosen, all he has to do is adjust his various\
  \ skills, attack rolls, and DCs to reflect his increased level and new bonuses,\
  \ and he is done. He has everything he needs to continue adventuring with more than\
  \ a few new tricks up his sleeve.</p>\n              <h2>Each New Level, Repeat</h2>\n\
  \              <p>Each time you gain a level, the method by which you increase your\
  \ level stays the same. Only the details and choices change. To make it easy for\
  \ you to remember what you need to do each level, there's a bullet-point list on\
  \ page 31 of the Pathfinder Second Edition Core Rulebook. Follow those directions\
  \ each level, and you'll be set.</p>\n              <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\
  \               <img src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190715-levelingupchecklist.jpg\"\
  \ alt=\"Leveling-up Checklist. Every time you gain a level, make sure you do each\
  \ of the following: \r\n- Increase your level by 1 and subtract 1,000 XP from your\
  \ XP total.\r\n- Increase your maximum Hit Points by the amount listed in your class\
  \ entry in Chapter 3. \r\nAdd class features from your class advancement table,\
  \ including ability boosts and skill increases.\r\n- Select feats as indicated on\
  \ your class advancement table. For ancestry feats, see Chapter 2. For class feats,\
  \ see your class entry in Chapter 3. For general feats and skill feats, see Chapter\
  \ 5. \r\n- Add spells and spell slots if your class grants spell casting. See Chapter\
  \ 7 for spells.\r\n- Increase all of your proficiency bonuses by 1 from your new\
  \ level, and make other increases to your proficiency bonuses as necessary from\
  \ skill increases or other class features. \r\n- Increase any other statistics that\
  \ changed as a result of ability boots or other abilities.\r\n- Adjust bonuses from\
  \ feats and other abilities that are based on your level.\" style=\"padding-bottom:\
  \ 30px;\">\n              </div>\n              <p>When Kaliban reaches 3rd level,\
  \ even though he's multiclassed into wizard, he is still primarily a fighter, and\
  \ he is going to advance as a 3rd-level fighter. He'll gain 12 more Hit Points (bringing\
  \ his total to 44) and get the bravery class feature, along with a general feat\
  \ and a skill increase. First, let's take a look at bravery.</p>\n             \
  \ <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n               <img src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190715-bravery.jpg\"\
  \ alt=\"Bravery. 3rd.\r\nHaving faced countless foes and the chaos of battle, you\
  \ have learned how to stand strong in the face of fear and keep on fighting. Your\
  \ proficiency rank for Will saves increases to expert. When you roll a success at\
  \ a Will save against a fear effect, you get a critical success instead.  In addition,\
  \ any time you gain the frightened condition, reduce its value by 1.\" style=\"\
  padding-bottom: 20px;\">\n              </div>\n              <p>While Kaliban is\
  \ trained in Will saving throws, during character creation he chose to boost Intelligence\
  \ instead of Wisdom, so bravery is going to be a big help. At second level his Will\
  \ saving throw was +4. Thanks to bravery it jumps up to a +7 while granting him\
  \ some extra protection against fear effects.</p>\n              <p>The skill increase\
  \ allows him to either become trained in a new skill or to become an expert in a\
  \ skill he's already trained in. Kaliban has a pretty robust set of skills, especially\
  \ for a fighter, so he is going to invest the skill increase in raising one of his\
  \ skills to expert proficiency. Since he's been focusing many of his build resources\
  \ into his magical training, this time he'll use his skill training to become an\
  \ expert in Athletics.</p>\n              <p>What about that general feat? Well,\
  \ it just so happens that Magical Crafting pops up at 2nd level, so maybe Kaliban\
  \ can find a way to increase his power in the magical arts after all.</p>\n    \

  \ attacker and several glowing blue energy knives are bursting out of it from a\

  \              <p>In the end, each level that you attain increases your ability\
  \ to customize your character. We only completed two levels of Kaliban's advancement,\
  \ and he has made many exciting and diverse choices, most of which were out of the\
  \ ordinary. Not only does the fighter have an abundance of choice with just fighter\
  \ class feats, but by taking dedication feats to multiclass or take on an archetype,\
  \ the fighter increases the number and variety of choices available to him at each\
  \ new level. Add to that further customization through skill advancement, general\
  \ feats (skill and otherwise), and ancestry feats gained after 1st level, and at\
  \ every level your adventurer becomes a unique legend sure to leave a mark on your\
  \ campaign's story and the world of Pathfinder.</p>\n              <p style=\"margin-left:\
