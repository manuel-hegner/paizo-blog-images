  \ itemprop=\"description\">Congratulations on surviving Gen Con, players! I’m assuming,\
  \ anyway. Like the June update, I’m writing this before Gen Con even begins. What\
  \ did you think of those new announcements? That Starfinder Second Edition sounds\
  \ pretty cool! [note to future self: remove this if we don’t announce it so I don’\
  t blow the surprise]</p> \n      <p>Seriously though, I’m SO excited to finally\
  \ be able to share all the new information with you all! The new edition of Starfinder,\
  \ a playtest coming up for Pathfinder, the Remaster on the horizon, and so much\
  \ more. It’s an exciting time at Paizo HQ! And this blog is chock-full of information,\
  \ so let’s dive right in.</p> \n      <br> \n      <h2>Digital Adventure Releases</h2>\
  \ \n      <p>These adventures will be available on August 30, 2023.</p> \n     \
  \ <h3>Pathfinder Society</h3> \n      <p><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02ejg?Pathfinder-Society-Intro-Year-of-Unfettered-Exploration\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Intro: Year of Unfettered Exploration</a>*<br> <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02ejh?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-502-The-Blackwood-Lost\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Scenario #5-02: The Blackwood Lost</a>*</p> \n      <h3>Starfinder\
  \ Society</h3> \n      <p><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02eji?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-606-Tomorrows-Seekers\"\
  >Starfinder Society Scenario #6-06: Tomorrow's Seekers</a>*† <br> <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02ejj?Starfinder-Bounty-9-Burning-Ambitions\"\
  >Starfinder Bounty #9: Burning Ambitions</a></p> \n      <p>*part of a subscription<br>\
  \ † released early to Venture Officers to run during the month of August</p> \n\
  \      <br> \n      <h2>Convention News</h2> \n      <p>This section usually lives\
  \ at the bottom of the blog, but there’s some news I wanted to make sure had a prominent\
  \ place! The OP team’s travel schedule for the rest of 2023 has been locked in.\
  \ Here’s where you can come out and meet us!</p> \n      <p><strong>August 18-20</strong>:\
  \ I will be at <a href=\"https://dragonflight.org/\">Dragonflight</a> in Bellevue,\
  \ WA somewhat unofficially.</p> \n      <p><strong>September 1-4 (Labor Day weekend)</strong>:\
  \ I will be attending <a href=\"https://www.strategicon.net/\">Gateway</a> in Los\
  \ Angeles, CA.</p> \n      <p>Additionally, <strong>Josh Foster</strong> will be\
  \ attending <a href=\"https://www.dragoncon.org/\">DragonCon</a> in Atlanta, GA!</p>\
  \ \n      <p><strong>September 29-October 1</strong>: <strong>Jessica Catalan</strong>\
  \ and I (as well as possibly others) will be attending <a href=\"https://skalcon.org/\"\
  >SkålCon</a> in Minneapolis, MN. A number of Paizo staffers and freelancers will\
  \ also be at <a href=\"https://www.bigbadcon.com/\">BigBadCon</a> in San Francisco,\
  \ though we don't have an official presence.</p> \n      <p>Finally, and perhaps\
  \ most newsworthy...<br> </p>\n      <p><strong>December 1-3</strong>: Paizo returns\
  \ to <strong>PAX Unplugged</strong> in Philadelphia, PA! <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sidm\"\
  >Volunteer applications are now open</a>. This convention will be the first chance\
  \ for you to demo <strong>Starfinder Second Edition </strong>with a member of the\
  \ Starfinder team!</p> \n      <p>We'll also be running acquisition-focused tables\
  \ of Pathfinder, Starfinder, and for the first time, board game demos of <em>Goblin\
  \ Firework Fight</em> and <em>Elemental Stones</em>! I'm very excited to be returning\
  \ to the show. Again, applications are now open, and we’d love to have you join\
  \ us!</p> \n      <p>On top of all of these, the fall months are some of our most\
  \ active for local conventions. These smaller conventions are a great way to meet\
  \ your local Pathfinder and Starfinder community, so we recommend you check out\
  \ our <a href=\"https://paizo.com/conventions\">convention calendar</a> to find\
  \ one near you!</p> \n      <br> \n      <h2>Sanctioning Updates</h2> \n      <p>Has\
  \ anything interesting been released for Pathfinder lately? Probably not, right?</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Ah, well, except <em>Pathfinder </em><em>Rage of Elements</em>. That’\
  s pretty exciting, and it’s now sanctioned for play! Rules are available on the\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions\">Character Options\
  \ page</a>, and there are new boons in the Boon Store for some of the Uncommon options.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>For Starfinder Society, the Drift Hackers Adventure Path sanctioning\
  \ documents have finally been uploaded, allowing you to earn credit for playing\
  \ through the adventures!</p> \n      <p>Coming up next will be sanctioning for\
  \ <em>Pathfinder Adventure: Rusthenge</em> and the Sky King’s Tomb Adventure Path,\
  \ as well as <em>Starfinder Enhanced</em>. Now that we’re on the other side of Gen\
  \ Con, we’re also going to be spending time working on the rules regarding the new\
  \ Remastered books, which we hope to have ready well in advance of their release.</p>\
  \ \n      <br> \n      <h2>Pathfinder Class Playtest</h2> \n      <p>The Pathfinder\
  \ Rules &amp; Lore team has announced the next class playtest scheduled for September\
  \ 1! Pathfinder Society will support this playtest as we’ve supported all class\
  \ playtests using the rules in the <a href=\"https://organizedplayfoundation.org/Lorespire/pfs2guide._.Playtest-Rules\"\
  >Guide to Organized Play</a>. In short: you can build and play characters using\
  \ the new rules and apply credit to your existing characters as if they were pregenerated\
  \ characters.</p> \n      <p>Remember that GM participation in playtests is opt-in.\
  \ If a GM chooses not to allow characters from a ruleset they’re not familiar with,\
  \ that’s entirely acceptable! We hope you all enjoy the newest creations from the\
  \ Rules &amp; Lore team. </p> \n      <br> \n      <h2>Starfinder Second Edition\
  \ Field Tests</h2> \n      <p>Starfinder Second Edition is coming! In anticipation\
  \ of the full playtest in 2024, the Starfinder team has begun releasing <em>Starfinder\
  \ Field Tests</em>. These bite-size PDFs are packed with information on upcoming\
  \ classes and rules, as well as the design team’s goals and thoughts. You can download\
  \ the first one at starfinderplaytest.com.</p> \n      <p>We just want to clarify\
  \ that for Starfinder Society play, these options are <strong>not legal</strong>.\
  \ Once we get closer to the full playtest, we’ll share the specifics of how Starfinder\
  \ Society will support it. For now, please enjoy the previews and get ready to playtest\
  \ at our conventions next year!</p> \n      <br> \n      <h2>Pathfinder and Starfinder\
  \ Society on Foundry VTT</h2> \n      <p>Some exciting news for our Foundry GMs\
  \ and players!</p> \n      <p>Starting August 30th, we’ll be giving Pathfinder and\
  \ Starfinder Society the same premium treatment on Foundry VTT that we’ve been giving\
  \ our Pathfinder Adventure Paths. Each of these modules will be a one-time purchase\
  \ that will be updated throughout the season with new content as we release it,\
  \ and will be available in both a streamlined version that only provides maps and\
  \ tokens for those who own the PDFs as well as a deluxe version that also includes\
  \ fully-styled journals containing all of the adventure content. Keep an eye on\
  \ the Paizo blog for updates!</p> \n      <br> \n      <h2>First Seeker Election</h2>\
  \ \n      <p>The polls have opened for the Starfinder Society’s First Seeker election!\
  \ Agents are flocking from around the galaxy to cast their votes. The early polls\
  \ are in, and the race is neck and neck (and neck and neck)!</p> \n      <p>While\
  \ <em>Starfinder Society Scenario #6-06: Tomorrow’s Seekers</em> releases at the\
  \ end of the month, Venture Officers have been granted early access to maximize\
  \ your opportunities to play the adventure before casting your vote. We encourage\
  \ you all to get out and meet the candidates! As it’s repeatable, you can even play\
  \ it multiple times for credit to get the clearest view of your options. Once you’\
  ve done so, head to <a href=\"https://paizo.com/starfindersociety/firstseeker\"\
  >paizo.com/firstseeker</a> to cast your vote.</p> \n      <br> \n      <h2>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Year 5 Updates</h2> \n      <p>With the launch of PFS Year 5 last week,\
  \ the following updates have gone into effect!</p> \n      <ul> \n       <li>The\
  \ <strong>changeling</strong> versatile heritage is now freely available to all\
  \ players, due to the Society’s adventures involving the night hag Aslynn.</li>\
  \ \n       <li>More adventurers of uncommon ancestries have joined the Pathfinder\
  \ Society in the past few years, so the <strong>tengu</strong> and <strong>ratfolk</strong>\
  \ ancestries are also freely available!</li> \n       <li>Additionally, in preparation\
  \ for their inclusion in the upcoming <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02ej2?Pathfinder-Player-Core\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Player Core</em></a> book, the <strong>tiefling</strong> and <strong>aasimar</strong>\
  \ versatile heritages are freely available to all players.</li> \n       <li>Boons\
  \ for all of the above freely available options have been removed from the Boon\
  \ Store. Players who previously purchased those boons will have them updated to\
  \ grant a free use of the resurrection ritual to those characters, as we have done\
  \ for past ancestries.</li> \n       <li>Finally, due to the influx of planar energy\
  \ throughout Golarion, the <strong>geniekin</strong> versatile heritage has been\
  \ reduced to 40 Achievement Points! This boon has also been updated to include the\
  \ <strong>talos</strong> and <strong>ardande</strong>heritages from <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02eju?Pathfinder-Rage-of-Elements\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Rage of Elements</em></a>.</li> \n      </ul> \n      <br> \n  \
  \    <h2>Boon Updates</h2> \n      <h3>Boon Request Threads</h3> \n      <p>The\
  \ OP team gets requests all the time for boons for character options. Now that the\
  \ Boon Store is up and running, I thought it would be best to centralize those requests\
  \ in one location, so I did that! There are now Boon Request threads for <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/threads/rzs43ubf?Official-Pathfinder-Society-Boon-Request-Thread\"\
  >Pathfinder Society</a> and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/threads/rzs43ubg?Official-Starfinder-Society-Boon-Request-Thread\"\
  >Starfinder Society </a>pinned in their respective forums. Feel free to head over\
  \ to favorite the suggestions you like and add new ones if they haven’t already\
  \ been posted.</p> \n      <h3>Seeker of Knowledge</h3> \n      <p>Just a note that,\
  \ now that replays are functional, the Seeker of Knowledge boons in the boon store\
  \ also now work correctly! Purchasing one of these boons grants your account 4 SFS\
  \ Replays, one per reputation tier. Players who previously purchased these boons\
  \ should now see four additional Replays in their account as well.</p> \n      <br>\
  \ \n      <h2>Retail Incentive Program Updates</h2> \n      <p>Our Retail Incentive\
  \ Program is designed to help players support the game stores and venues that host\
  \ our games, often for free, while earning in-game benefits. Over the past year,\
  \ we’ve heard some recommendations to improve it, and I’m delighted to share the\
  \ new version of the program now!</p> \n      <p>You can download PDFs of the rules\
  \ for <a href=\"https://downloads.paizo.com/RetailerIncentiveProgram_PFS.pdf\">Pathfinder\
  \ Society</a> and <a href=\"https://downloads.paizo.com/RetailerIncentiveProgram_SFS.pdf\"\
  >Starfinder Society</a> now on the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/organizedplay/policies\"\
  >Retail Incentive Program page</a>. The major changes are:</p> \n      <ul> \n \
  \      <li>Adding a new “heroic” tier, unlocked when a table spends of $100 or more</li>\
  \ \n       <li>Altering or replacing boons that reduced the gold cost of healing\
  \ now that those benefits primarily use Achievement Points</li> \n       <li>Making\
  \ the benefits more versatile and/or slightly more useful</li> \n      </ul> \n\
  \      <p>Overall, the intention of programs like the RIP and the Accessory Perks\
  \ is to provide incentives to players and GMs to support our products and venues.\
  \ The goal is not for these to be hard rules, but to encourage GMs and organizers\
  \ to adopt a “spirit of the law” reading of any of these programs to ensure all\
  \ players are enjoying themselves. Thanks to all the volunteers who provided feedback\
  \ on these revisions!</p> \n      <br> \n      <h2>GM Recognition</h2> \n      <h3>Campaign\
  \ Service Coins</h3> \n      <p>This month, two new Campaign Service Coins were\
  \ awarded to volunteers by their RVC. We award these coins to members of the community\
  \ who have gone above and beyond to provide an exceptional program to the community\
  \ at large. Campaign Coins are awarded based on nominations; if you believe someone\
  \ in your community is deserving of this award (whether or not they are a Venture\
  \ Officer), send an email to organizedplay@paizo.com with their name and reasons</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Congratulations to: <br> <b>Bill Tobin</b>, who now holds a campaign\
  \ coin and OP ID #896<br> <b>Brad Grinstead (bigrin42)</b>, who nows holds a campaign\
  \ coin and OP ID #897</p> \n      <p>Until next time - Explore! Report! Cooperate!\
  \ And unlock the elemental power within you!</p> \n      <p style=\"margin-left:\
