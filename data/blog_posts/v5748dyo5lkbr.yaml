  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, December 13, 2017</p> \n    <div itemprop=\"\
  articlebody\"> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">In Season 8 of the <a href=\"\
  /pathfindersociety/rpg\">Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild</a>, the Pathfinder\
  \ Society set its sights far from Golarion. Pathfinders soared through the skies\
  \ of the Plane of Air, swam through the endless oceans of the Plane of Water, embroiled\
  \ themselves in genie politics on the Plane of Fire, and brought lost and forgotten\
  \ secrets to light on the Plane of Earth. And while they were hopping through the\
  \ planes, the Pathfinders ran headfirst into the plans of a group called the Concordance\
  \ of Elements. The Concordance first came onstage as a fierce opponent to the Pathfinder\
  \ Society, but ultimately became an ally. In the interests of keeping this blog\
  \ low on spoilers, I'll just say: nothing like an angry demigod to help two groups\
  \ set aside their differences. But what began as an alliance of desperation evolved\
  \ into a genuine partnership.</p> \n     <p>So what is the Concordance? It is an\
  \ ancient and diverse organization whose membership spans multiple planes, with\
  \ a particular focus on the elemental planes. Its members take great interest in\
  \ the interplay among the primal forces of air, earth, fire, and water. They believe\
  \ that the stability of the multiverse ultimately depends upon these forces—and\
  \ many others—remaining in balance.</p> \n     <p>Each member has her own ideas\
  \ about how to maintain this equilibrium. Some of them set upon a perilous quest\
  \ for understanding in places where elemental forces are at their strongest, from\
  \ howling blizzards to ferocious thunderstorms to active volcanoes. Others seek\
  \ to refine the balance within, mastering magical forces or fighting styles that\
  \ evoke multiple elements. Still others search for yawning planar rifts and other\
  \ massive disturbances to study or seal away.</p> \n     <p>As an organization,\
  \ the Concordance believes that each individual member's personal journey of discovery\
  \ is important. Its leaders, collectively known as the Cycle of Five, spend much\
  \ of their time in meditation and reflection, leaving its agents free to act with\
  \ relative autonomy. Of course, agents who contribute more to the Concordance's\
  \ collective knowledge and overarching goals gain deeper access to its ancient reservoirs\
  \ of elemental knowledge and power. Such ambitious agents would do well to seek\
  \ out opportunities to make a name for themselves. Fortunately for Pathfinders interested\
  \ in gaining influence, the Society's contact in the Concordance is a direct emissary\
  \ to the Cycle of Five. He is our new faction leader: Ashasar, Liaison to the Seat\
  \ of Balance, a Suli druid with an airship-shaped air elemental companion, as well\
  \ as three other elemental companions who will be showing up in future scenarios.</p>\

  \ <p>So what does the Concordance bring to the Pathfinder Society? It brings a fresh\
  \ perspective on Golarion combined with a rich reservoir of planar and elemental\
  \ knowledge. The Pathfinder Society has shown the Concordance that Golarion is a\
  \ world worth exploring in much more detail. From the erratic magic of the Mana\
  \ Wastes to the Abendego-battered Sodden Lands, the Concordance has just begun to\
  \ scratch the surface. The Concordance is a nature faction, but it's not a typical\
  \ nature faction. Its members respect nature, and typical nature-themed characters\
  \ like druids and rangers are quite welcome in its ranks. Still, you're more likely\
  \ to find someone in the Concordance trying to channel the essence of a hurricane\
  \ than you are to find them attempting to befriend every plant and animal they meet.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>If you're interested in learning more about the Concordance, check out\
  \ the scenarios that have already featured their story: </p>\n     <ul>\n      <li><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Scenario #7-99: Through Maelstrom Rift</em> (6th-level Pregenerated Characters)</li>\
  \ \n      <li><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-08—Tyranny of Winds, Part 1: The\
  \ Sandstorm Prophecy</em> (Tier 1-5)</li> \n      <li><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario\
  \ #8-10—Tyranny of Winds, Part 2: Secrets of the Endless Sky</em> (Tier 1-5)</li>\
  \ \n      <li><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-12—Tyranny of Winds, Part 3: Caught\
  \ in the Eclipse</em> (Tier 3-7)</li> \n      <li><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario\
  \ #8-17: Refugees of the Weary Sky</em> (Tier 7-11)</li> \n      <li><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Society Scenario #8-24: Raid on the Cloudborne Keep</em> (Tier 5-9)</li>\n   \
  \  </ul> \n     <p>Since this is the Year of Faction's Favor, we would be remiss\
  \ not to give our newest faction a chance to shine. We've got opportunities coming\
  \ up in February for both Pathfinder Society campaigns. In Pathfinder Society Scenario\
  \ #9-14, the Society will call upon the Concordance's expertise to investigate bizarre\
  \ phenomena in the Verduran Forest. Meanwhile, in Season 4 of the <a href=\"/pathfindersociety/acg\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventure Card Guild's</a>, Ashasar will help the PCs quell an unnatural\
  \ storm. The Concordance will also appear in the upcoming Player Companion <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9xew?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Disciples-Doctrine\"><em>Disciple's\
  \ Doctrine</em></a>.</p> \n     <p>Interested in joining the Concordance? Ashasar\
  \ is about to start an active recruitment drive, traveling from lodge to lodge across\
  \ the Inner Sea and beyond. If your character would like to become a part of this\
  \ new initiative, keep an eye out for the faction's formal launch in early 2018.\
  \ As with other faction changes, you'll be able to switch your character over to\
  \ the Concordance freely without spending Prestige Points. As a part of this launch,\
  \ we'll be updating the <a href=\"/products/btpy84k4?Pathfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Guide\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild Guide</em></a> to include the Concordance\
  \ and giving the faction a shiny new Faction Journal card.</p> \n     <p>Linda Zayas-Palmer<br>\
