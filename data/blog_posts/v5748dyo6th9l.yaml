  \     <blockquote>\n      <p><em>Guest blog from Ben Loomes, Syrinscape CEO and\
  \ Creative Director</em></p>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Hello! Ben, the\
  \ CEO and Creative Director of <a href=\"https://syrinscape.com/\">Syrinscape</a>\
  \ here. My favorite adventure of all time is Red Hand of Doom, which I've run four\
  \ times—once in its original 3.5 system, and three times adapted for Pathfinder.\
  \ The first and second SoundSets I ever built for <a href=\"https://syrinscape.com/\"\
  >Syrinscape</a> are named \"Bugbear Battle,\" after the very first encounter in\
  \ Red Hand, and \"Witchwood,\" after the spooky dangerous forest where much of the\
  \ opening adventure takes place.</p>\n      <p>I am VERY excited to run <a href=\"\
  https://syrinscape.com/store/613-seven-dooms-sandpoint-one/\">Seven Dooms of Sandpoint</a>!\
  \ This amazing adventure was co-written by James Jacobs. I'm a not-so-secret über-fan\
  \ of James, so I’m always excited to see new stuff from him.</p>\n      <div class=\"\

  s jump from the first two Sandpoint <a href=\"https://syrinscape.com/store/613-seven-dooms-sandpoint-one/\"\
  >SoundSets</a> created for Syrinscape to the latest two. Number 1,081 (“Bones and\
  \ Ashes”) and Number 1,082 (“Strange Times in Sandpoint”) were built to support\
  \ the opening of this fantastic NEW adventure. Nowadays Syrinscape has a few more\
  \ content creators than just me; while it’s still much of my music in there, Chris\
  \ Körding built these sounds AND contributed even more rich evocative music of his\
  \ own.</p>\n      <p>Back in 2009, Chris was playing <a href=\"https://syrinscape.com/store/?q=rise&amp;order=featured&amp;game-system=pathfinder&amp;type=everything\"\
  >Rise of the Runelords</a> when, as he describes it, \"Syrinscape came along and\
  \ released the official soundscapes (SoundSets) for the adventure I was playing\
  \ and I was blown away by the richness and textures and what it provided to the\
  \ gaming table. Needless to say, <a href=\"https://syrinscape.com/\">Syrinscape</a>\
  \ became a permanent addition to every gaming session.”</p>\n      <p>Chris adds,\
  \ “Fast forward to 2024 and Adventure Path 200! But this time I get to bring it\
  \ to life for Syrinscape. Expanding from the original adventures and sounds, what\
  \ could I do to propel it to the roaring 20s?\" Nowadays, Syrinscape is more powerful—\
  it can run more channels of sound, with individual reverb units set for every channel,\
  \ and run sounds which are positioned binaurally for an increased sense of immersion.\
  \ So, what has Chris done with these new capabilities? He’s had fun, that’s what!</p>\n\

  \     <br>\n      <p>Syrinscape supports all the key locations in this “new” Sandpoint\
  \ with specifically crafted ambiances. Traps and dramatic events are meticulously\
  \ crafted for maximum shock and affect. Encounters feature dramatic music to help\
  \ keep everyone focused and specifically voiced creatures to trigger all those subconscious\
  \ fears! And of course, as always, <a href=\"https://syrinscape.com/\">Syrinscape</a>\
  \ is 100% customizable.</p>\n      <p>When it comes to the music we have created,\
  \ Chris says, “Don’t want piano hits? Just stop the element. Need some extra choir\
  \ sounds? Just hit play on THAT element and you have your angelic voices. All of\
  \ this can easily be done with the power Syrinscape puts into your hands.” With\
  \ a <a href=\"https://syrinscape.com/subscriptions/3-supersyrin/\">SuperSyrin</a>\
  \ sub, you can even compose your own music and upload it to play along with the\
  \ ambiances we designed. Syrinscape’s support for the Seven Dooms for Sandpoint\
  \ Adventure Path is rich, specific, and immersive.</p>\n      <p>If you haven’t\
  \ used Syrinscape at your table before, now might just be the time to give it a\
  \ go! And if you are playing remotely with a team of headphone-wearing warriors,\
  \ Syrinscape has you sorted with our new <a href=\"https://app.syrinscape.com/\"\
  >Web Player</a>, which lets you share your audio with any of your friends ,wherever\
  \ they are, with just a simple link they can open in any browser. We hope you love\
  \ what we have <a href=\"https://syrinscape.com/store/613-seven-dooms-sandpoint-one/\"\
  >built for this adventure</a>. We believe that using Syrinscape in your <a href=\"\
  https://syrinscape.com/pathfinder/\">Pathfinder</a> and <a href=\"https://syrinscape.com/starfinder/\"\
  >Starfinder</a> games will deliver a world-class gaming experience so everyone in\
