  \ \n      <p>Hi everyone, Mark Seifter here. I’m excited to announce a new Kickstarter\
  \ from Roll for Combat, which went live today at <a href=\"http://kickstarter.rollforcombat.com\"\
  >http://kickstarter.rollforcombat.com</a>! The Kickstarter features three exciting\
  \ sourcebooks described below!</p> \n      <p><b><em>Battlezoo Eldamon</em></b>\
  \ lets you befriend, train, battle, and evolve ancient and playful monsters based\
  \ on 10–20 elemental types, such as fire, ice, death, and possibly even music and\
  \ time! Eldamon are slightly out of phase with reality and like to meld into items,\
  \ creatures, and locations. You can add them seamlessly into any setting, allowing\
  \ characters to interact with and collect them without disrupting the established\
  \ adventure or requiring the GM to rebuild or change encounters. Anyone can befriend\
  \ eldamon and have them fight playful mock duels with each other, but only the eldamon\
  \ trainer class can phase them into our world to use them in combat against deadly\
  \ threats. Meanwhile, as an elemental avatar, you have a powerful but quiescent\
  \ eldamon melded into you, allowing you to harness the power of their strange abilities!\
  \ <em>Battlezoo Eldamon</em> is perfect for monster-training lovers of all ages.\
  \ The rules are simple enough to offer a great way to introduce children to the\
  \ game but deep enough to provide a variety of combinations for strategic players.\
  \ In addition to the rulebook for Pathfinder, you can also get your hands on a card\
  \ game called <em>Eldamon Battles</em> (offering players the chance to experience\
  \ duels between eldamon quickly and strategically), plushies of six of the most\
  \ common eldamon, battle minis, dice sets, leather notebooks, and more!</p> \n \

  \ \n      </div> \n      <p><b><em>Battlezoo Ancestries: Year of Monsters</em></b>\
  \ sends a monstrous new ancestry to your inbox every month, plus a final compilation\
  \ book at the end that collects all the ancestries and offers more additional content!\
  \ Such ancestries include demons, gremlins, intelligent weapons, dungeons expanded\
  \ (you can get the original dungeon ancestry for free, despite the stated price\
  \ of 1 cent, at http://battlezoo.com), oni, nymphs, doppelgangers, minotaurs, slimes,\
  \ sthenos, mimics, and sidhe. Each ancestry will receive roughly twice as much content\
  \ as a standard size ancestry, such as those presented in the <em>Core Rulebook\
  \ or Lost Omens Ancestry Guide</em>. Thanks to stretch goals, some of the ancestry\
  \ options might expand even more!</p> \n      <p>Lastly, <em><b>Battlezoo Bestiary\
  \ Strange &amp; Unusual</b></em> is the result of the 2021 RPG Superstar contest,\
  \ licensed from Paizo. It features 150 award-winning monsters, an expansion of the\
  \ monster parts system from <em>Battlezoo Bestiary</em>, the aberrant soul archetype\
  \ (an option for characters who are slowly transforming into aberrations), and more.\
  \ </p> \n      <p>I’m very excited about these new projects, and I hope you’ll check\
  \ out the Kickstarter at <a href=\"http://kickstarter.rollforcombat.com\">http://kickstarter.rollforcombat.com</a>.\
