  > \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Making my way back from the Las Vegas Open\
  \ to spend some time in the office before heading out to DundraCon in a few weeks.\
  \ The Open is a small con with large growth potential. Currently focused on war\
  \ gaming, they are looking to expand into tabletop RPGs. I look forward to seeing\
  \ what they can do for 2018.</p> \n     <p>Once back in the office, the team and\
  \ I will be putting final polish on some items in preparation for announcing them\
  \ to our players. Keep an eye on the blogs throughout February for some exciting\
  \ news!</p> \n     <h2>Convention Travel Schedules</h2> \n     <p>With the launch\
  \ of the 2017 travel season, the team will be setting out for locations around the\
  \ world. Consider coming out to one of the conventions below to say hi and roll\
  \ some dice with us! Besides the list below, some of the Pathfinder Society staff\
  \ will be at Origins and the team will see you at PaizoCon and Gen Con 50! I'm asking\
  \ Chris to post the list on the website and will add more as we have confirmations.</p>\
  \ \n     <h3>Tonya</h3> \n     <ul>\n      <li>2/17-2/20 DundraCon, San Ramon, California</li>\
  \ \n      <li>3/2-3/5 Emerald City Comic Con, Seattle, Washington</li> \n      <li>3/31-4/2\
  \ Who's Yer Con, Indianapolis, Indiana</li> \n      <li>6/4-6/7 UK Games Expo, Birmingham,\
  \ United Kingdom</li>\n     </ul> \n     <h3>John</h3> \n     <p>Keeping him busy\
  \ with writing Season 8/9. He did get to attend SCARAB last month!</p> \n     <h3>Linda/Mark</h3>\
  \ \n     <ul>\n      <li>2/23-2/26 TotalCon, Marlborough, Massachusettes</li> \n\
  \      <li>4/22-4-23 Quad Cities GameFest, Davenport, Iowa</li>\n     </ul> \n \
  \    <h3>Other Paizo Staff</h3> \n     <ul>\n      <li>2/10-2/12 OwlCon, Dallas,\
  \ Texas</li> \n      <li>3/23-3/26 GaryCon, Lake Geneva, Wisconsin</li> \n     \
  \ <li>6/4-6/7 UK Games Expo, Birmingham, United Kingdom</li>\n     </ul> \n    \
  \ <h2>Interactive Specials</h2> \n     <p>It is our pleasure to announce two interactive\
  \ specials for this year's convention season. The first will debut at PaizoCon,\
  \ with its European Debut at UK Games Expo. It will be on limited release until\
  \ Gen Con, after which it will be available for conventions worldwide. This special,\
  \ titled \"The Solstice Scar\" is a multi-table RPG interactive for levels 1-11.\
  \ There are a few twists, but I'll leave it to John to tell those tidbits in a later\
  \ blog.</p> \n     <p>The second special will debut at Gen Con and will be a multi-table\
  \ interactive for both RPG and ACG. Once again, I'll leave it to John to reveal\
  \ the details.</p> \n     <h2>5-Star GMs</h2> \n     <p>Another month means more\
  \ GMs reaching the 5-star goal. The following GMs successfully ran 150 games, including\
  \ 10 special scenarios and 50 unique adventures. They also ran a game for a Venture-Captain,\
  \ who confirmed they know what they are about. Thanks for the hours and hours of\
  \ effort that went into completing the tasks. Congratulations on reaching your 5th\
  \ star.</p> \n     <ul>\n      <li>Brent Bowser</li> \n      <li>Chris Brockley-Blatt</li>\
  \ \n      <li>Brian Brumbaugh</li> \n      <li>Geoff Griffith</li> \n      <li>J\
  \ Michael Neal</li> \n      <li>James Risner</li>\n     </ul> \n     <h2>Gen Con\
  \ Volunteer Update</h2> \n     <p>So far, 231 volunteers completed the questionnaire.\
  \ But there is still space on the volunteer roster. This year, we have over 160\
  \ tables of games scheduled for each slot at the Gen Con! Which translates in to\
  \ loads of GMs and volunteers. I'm starting the task of emailing potential volunteers\
  \ today and hope to have them all completed by Thursday morning. If you haven't\
  \ gotten a status update by Thursday evening, and you checked your inbox, your spam\
  \ filter, and your cat (because we all know cats have mysterious powers), then send\
  \ me an email (<a href=\"mailto:genconpfsvolunteer@paizo.com\">genconpfsvolunteer@paizo.com</a>)\
  \ and we can sort things out.</p> \n     <p>If your interested in volunteering,\
  \ check out the <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ljif?A-Call-to-VolHow-to-Volunteer-for-Organized\"\
  >Call for Vols Blog</a> and click on the questionnaire link at the bottom.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Also, snow has arrived in Seattle! Good thing I still have my winter boots.\
  \ But that asks the question—where is your next game? Do share your exciting Pathfinder\
  \ Society plans! The team may find a new convention to attend!</p> \n     <p>Until\
  \ next time—Explore, Report, Cooperate!</p> \n     <p>Tonya Woldridge<br> <i>Organized\
