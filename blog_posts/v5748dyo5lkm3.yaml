  \ </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">The term \"proficiency\" has been a part\
  \ of the Pathfinder rules since the very beginning, but in the <em>Pathfinder Playtest\
  \ Rulebook</em>, we've expanded the concept to cover more than just weapons and\
  \ armor. In the new proficiency system, your proficiency matters for just about\
  \ every check you attempt and DC you have. You don't just have proficiency in weapons,\
  \ which helps when you swing a sword, or proficiency in armor, which protects you\
  \ when you try to avoid a blow—instead, proficiency covers everything from axes\
  \ to spells, from Acrobatics to Thievery, and from Perception to Will saves. Your\
  \ proficiency in Fortitude saves can allow you to shake off virulent poisons in\
  \ an instant, and your proficiency in Diplomacy might help you stop a fight before\
  \ it begins. There are five different ranks of proficiency.</p> \n    <h2>Untrained</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>An untrained character lacks even basic proficiency. He adjusts his checks\
  \ and DCs by –2 and sometimes flat-out can't attempt certain things. For instance,\
  \ someone who is untrained in Thievery might be able to try to steal from someone\
  \ but isn't skilled enough to pick a lock, no matter how high level he is.</p> \n\

  ></a> \n     <p><i>Illustration by Wayne Reynolds</i></p>\n    </div> \n    <h2>Trained</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>A trained character has put in enough work that she's able to perform\
  \ effectively. She can even start taking skill feats to achieve new and special\
  \ effects with her skills. Many skill feats grow more and more powerful as your\
  \ proficiency rank increases.</p> \n    <h2>Expert</h2> \n    <p>An expert is particularly\
  \ accomplished in a particular field, adjusting her checks and DCs by +1, and gains\
  \ access to more powerful features requiring expertise.</p> \n    <h2>Master</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>A master is extremely skilled in an area, and she can achieve incredible\
  \ results. In addition to adjusting her checks and DCs by +2, she may unlock powerful\
  \ perks like master-level skill feats for skills, or the ability to dodge fireballs\
  \ completely for Reflex saves. Other than a few classes like fighters, with their\
  \ incredible command of weapons, characters can't become masters until level 7 at\
  \ the earliest, and sometimes much later.</p> \n    <h2>Legendary</h2> \n    <p>A\
  \ legendary character is world-class, and in addition to adjusting checks and DCs\
  \ by +3, can routinely produce results that defy real-world explanation, even if\
  \ they're not a spellcaster. For instance, a character who is legendary in Survival\
  \ could learn to survive without food, water, or air in a featureless void, a character\
  \ legendary in Thievery might be able to steal the armor off a guard, and a character\
  \ with a legendary Will save might have a mind so strong that no mental intrusion\
  \ can fully affect him. Most characters can't hope to become legendary until level\
  \ 15 at the earliest, and even the mightiest fighters reach these heights with their\
  \ weapons only at level 13. Most characters become legendary in only a few skills\
  \ and one or two other statistics.</p> \n    <h2>Proficiency Modifier</h2> \n  \
  \  <p>Your proficiency modifier is based partly on your rank and partly on your\
  \ level—you add your level to the modifier from your rank to determine your proficiency\
  \ modifier. For instance, a level 20 rogue who is legendary at Stealth might have\
  \ a +23 proficiency modifier, while a level 1 paladin who is untrained at Stealth\
  \ might have a –1 proficiency modifier. But does that mean that your level 20 untrained\
  \ and magic-hating barbarian knows more about arcane magic than your friend's level\
  \ 1 bibliophile wizard does? Not really. Your barbarian, with her extensive experience\
  \ in battle, might be able to identify a dragon's weaknesses much better than the\
  \ wizard with his ivory-tower book learning, but when it comes to magical theory,\
  \ identifying the gestures that compose a spell, or other such topics, your barbarian\
  \ simply doesn't know anything at all.</p> \n    <h2>Gaining Proficiency</h2> \n\
  \    <p>For most of your statistics, your starting proficiencies are determined\
  \ by your class, though for skills, you can assign your ranks as you choose among\
  \ any of the skills in the game. When it comes to leveling up, all classes gain\
  \ skill rank increases at every odd-numbered level (or more often for the rogue!).\
  \ Your other proficiencies increase based on your class and feat choices.</p> \n\
  \    <h2>Making the Nonmagical Extraordinary</h2> \n    <p>The best part about proficiencies\
  \ is the way they push the boundaries for nonmagical characters, particularly those\
  \ with a legendary rank. If you're legendary in something, you're like a character\
  \ out of real-world myth and legend, swimming across an entire sea while beating\
  \ up sea monsters like Beowulf, performing unbelievable tasks like Heracles, or\
  \ hunting and racing at astounding speeds like Atalanta. While we did perform a\
  \ bit of research on things like real world Olympic records and average expectations\
  \ when it came to the lower ranks, masters and especially legends break all those\
  \ rules. Want your fighter to leap 20 feet straight up and smash a chimera down\
  \ to the ground? You can do that (eventually)!</p> \n    <p>And that's the basics\
  \ of how proficiency works! Thanks for reading, and let us know what you think in\
  \ the comments.</p> \n    <p>Mark Seifter<br> <i>Designer</i></p> \n   </div> <!--\
