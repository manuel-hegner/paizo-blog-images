  \ Society Organized Play Part XI: Pick Your Pace</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday,\
  \ May 31, 2011</p> \n   <p>Well, loyal Pathfinders, I have returned from a weeklong\
  \ adventure in which I conducted an ancient ritual at the prophesied time to eternally\
  \ bond me with an intelligent magic item of incredibly high Charisma that now occupies\
  \ my left ring slot. And whether the Rapture came or not, I'm in heaven (though\
  \ there's little time to take in the sights as we scramble to get the finishing\
  \ touches on all the great new Pathfinder Society material debuting at PaizoCon\
  \ in little more than a week).</p> \n   <p>But enough about me and my new cohort\
  \ (or am I the cohort?). Let's talk about one of the biggest changes coming to Pathfinder\
  \ Society Organized Play next year: variable advancement tracks!</p>\n  </blockquote>\
  \ \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"\

  \ target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/PZO9235-Ezren_360.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a></td>\n     </tr>\n     <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" class=\"\

  \   </table>\n  </div>\n  <blockquote> \n   <p>Currently, all Pathfinder Society\
  \ PCs level at the same rate: 3 XP to level up, which breaks down to three scenarios\
  \ per level, or at the most 37 scenarios between character creation and retirement\
  \ after a completed 12th-level adventure arc. For someone playing only a handful\
  \ of scenarios a year at large conventions, this means they can play the same PC\
  \ for years and years and still feel like they're actually getting something out\
  \ of those few sessions they play at Gen Con or PaizoCon annually. But for players\
  \ who participate in the campaign on even a bi-weekly basis, they will have leveled\
  \ a character from inception to near retirement in just over a single year.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>We’ve listened to the feedback, and feel there's a simple solution already\
  \ present in our rules system. The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game includes several\
  \ different advancement tracks to allow GMs to run their campaigns at the pace that\
  \ works best for them and their players. While most of our products to date assume\
  \ the medium advancement track, some groups prefer using the fast or slow progressions\
  \ to move more quickly to higher-level play or to savor each step along the way\
  \ to 20th level. Pathfinder Society Organized Play will be implementing a similar\
  \ optional advancement track beginning in Season 3.</p> \n   <p>Players who enjoy\
  \ the three-scenario-per-level pace don’t need to do anything. For you, nothing\
  \ will change. But for those who want a slower progression, you can opt instead\
  \ to move at half-speed, earning only 1/2 XP, 1/2 the total maximum gold, and a\
  \ maximum of 1 Prestige Point per scenario. Because the net gain per level will\
  \ be the same whether you use the slow track over six adventures or the normal track\
  \ over three, PCs will be able to choose which progression they'll use for their\
  \ next level each time they gain a level.</p>\n   <p> </p>\n   <p>In addition to\
  \ allowing individuals to operate at their own pace, this plan should allow small\
  \ home groups or even growing store and convention groups to cooperate to ensure\
  \ that higher-level PCs slow down enough for new players or replacement characters\
  \ to catch up, condensing the level spread to make things easier for event coordinators.\
  \ I'm sure there are other benefits to these new options that we haven't even thought\
  \ of in-house yet. What most excites you about this new development?</p> \n   <p>Be\
  \ sure not to miss next week's Monday blog for a look at the fifth of the existing\
  \ factions: the decadent empire of Taldor. Anyone who's already played <i><a href=\"\
  /store/v5748btpy8i14\">The Dalsine Affair</a></i> likely already has an idea of\
  \ at least one change that will be coming to this faction—a change that players\
  \ of the four new scenarios at PaizoCon are likely to notice right away.</p> \n\
