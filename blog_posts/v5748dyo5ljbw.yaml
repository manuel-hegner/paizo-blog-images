  \ Character Ever (Spoiler: It's Really Mavaro)</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Tuesday,\

  description\">Hello again, everyone! Last time I got the chance to write a blog\
  \ for Paizo, I said that <a href=\"/blog/v5748dyo5lijp\">Alahazra was my favorite\
  \ character</a>. However, I have a confession to make: I lied. At the time I wrote\
  \ that blog, Alahazra was no longer my favorite character. You see, I was one of\
  \ the lucky few to get in on early playtesting of <a href=\"/products/btpy9mbg\"\
  >Mummy's Mask</a>, and the first time I ran through the scenarios, I played as Mavaro,\
  \ the Occultist from the <a href=\"/products/btpy9mbh\"><em>Mummy's Mask Character\
  \ Add-On Deck</em></a>. And Mavaro, my friends, is <i>truly</i> the Best. Character.\
  \ Ever.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/blog/PZO6031-MavaroTokenFront_180.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/blog/PZO6031-MavaroTokenFront_180.jpeg\"></a> <a href=\"\

  ></a>\n     <br><i>Just look at that extremely regal man!</i>\n    </div> \n   \
  \ <p>Mavaro is the most versatile character ever made for the game—even more so\
  \ than Rise of the Runelords Lini, and she was majorly versatile. At any given moment,\
  \ Mavaro can potentially have any skill in the game, and that skill will be equal\
  \ to his highest base skill, his Intelligence. This is thanks to the amazing power\
  \ that allows him to display a boon from his hand and gain all of the skills listed\
  \ in that boon's check to acquire section equal to his Intelligence, and that effect\
  \ lasts until the end of the turn. So, right from the start of the game, Mavaro\
  \ can have a d10 for every base skill as long as he has a Blessing of the Elements\
  \ to display. He can also use (almost) any weapon in the game with his Intelligence\
  \ as his base die: reveal it to use your Strength (for Melee weapons) or your Dexterity\
  \ (for Ranged weapons) skill and then display that same weapon to gain that skill\
  \ equal to his Intelligence.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\

  \     <br> <i>Take a look at those skills. They can ALL be yours!</i>\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p>This extreme versatility also bleeds over into his deck composition.\
  \ Mavaro's deck list starts off with no weapons, spells, or armors in it. However,\
  \ he can treat all three of these card types as if they were items, and he gets\
  \ <i>nine</i> of those to start. This means that you can tailor his deck to your\
  \ liking at the end of any scenario. Do you know that the next scenario has a lot\
  \ of golems in it, which are notoriously immune to spells? Drop all your attack\
  \ spells and pick up a few extra weapons. Are there a lot of locations coming up\
  \ that require Wisdom checks to close? Pick up a few items that can give you a good\
  \ Wisdom skill.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/blog/PZO6031-MavaroBack_360.jpeg\"\

  \     <br> <i>Did you notice that he can still gain 1 card feat each for weapon,\
  \ spell, and armor? This may come in handy...</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>The only\
  \ \"static\" cards in Mavaro's beginning deck are allies and blessings, so it's\
  \ important to choose them wisely. Every card that you put in Mavaro's deck should\
  \ have the ability to grant him a skill that he either doesn't have at all, or is\
  \ not very good at. Diversity is key, since you want him to have a card somewhere\
  \ in his deck for every situation imaginable. This also means that Mavaro is a huge\
  \ fan of examining cards in his location deck. Even though the Trigger trait might\
  \ make this a bit of a gamble sometimes, it's important to know what is coming next\
  \ so that you can make sure you will have the card in hand to grant you a needed\
  \ skill.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/blog/PZO6030-TombRaider_180.jpeg\"\

  ></a>\n     <br><i>All of these cards are excellent choices because of their myriad\
  \ of skills to acquire.</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>I could go on for pages and pages\
  \ about the best cards to pick for Mavaro as you move up through the adventure decks,\
  \ but we should probably talk about Mavaro's role card a bit. His roles are Acquisitor\
  \ and Channeler. The Acquisitor, as you might expect, is really good at acquiring\
  \ new cards. Without any power feats, Mavaro can discard a card to add a die to\
  \ his checks to acquire. Using a power feat, he can give that benefit to other characters\
  \ at his location. And in the Acquisitor role, he can take a power feat to reduce\
  \ the cost of that power from discarding a card to merely recharging a card. One\
  \ of the best feats in this role, however, is the ability to set aside items from\
  \ your hand before you reset your hand, effectively increasing your hand size significantly\
  \ if you've got several items in hand—and you could potentially have as many as\
  \ 8.The Channeler role focuses strongly on casting spells, gaining the Arcane and\
  \ Divine skills. Additionally, like <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/prd/occultAdventures/classes/occultist.html\"\
  >his RPG equivalent</a>, Mavaro can channel magic from objects into spells. In the\
  \ PACG, this takes the form of recharging a weapon, and armor, or an item to summon\
  \ and play a random spell that has the Attack trait, which is pretty amazing. Each\
  \ of Mavaro's roles also offers a power feat that lets you affect your Intelligence\
  \ checks after the roll. The Acquisitor's version lets you bury a card to add or\
  \ subtract 3, while the Channeler lets you discard an item to reroll the dice! These\
  \ are both really excellent powers for Mavaro, though it's important to remember\
  \ that not all of your checks are going to be based on Intelligence... His first\
  \ power lets him gain skills <i>equal</i> to his Intelligence, but doesn't actually\
  \ <i>use</i> his Intelligence, which is <a href=\"/threads/rzs2ty5g?Mummys-Mask-Mavaro-and-displaying-cards#30\"\
  >an important distinction</a>.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>I honestly have trouble choosing between these two roles...\
  \ They're both amazing!</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>Finally, I'd like to talk a little\
  \ bit about the <a href=\"/pfsacg\">Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild</a>\
  \ organized play program and how Mavaro can be used there. Though Mavaro doesn't\
  \ have his own <em>Occultist Class Deck</em>, Mavaro can be unlocked for PFSACG\
  \ play by completing the final adventure of <a href=\"/pfsacg/products/season2\"\
  >Season of the Runelords</a>. You'll use the <a href=\"/products/btpy9gdq\"><em>Inquisitor\
  \ Class Deck</em></a> with him, which is a great deck of cards overall but does\
  \ have some pitfalls when it comes to Mavaro. First, like many Class Decks, the\
  \ Basic blessings are Blessings of the Gods, and that card is one of relatively\
  \ few in the game which has no check to acquire. This makes all four of his starting\
  \ blessings useless for his best power. You will quickly want to replace them with\
  \ blessings that have at least Divine as an acquire option, which you can then display\
  \ to make use of several excellent Divine spells in the deck, including Weapon of\
  \ Awe and Divine Favor. You can also grab a Grave Tender as an early B ally upgrade.\
  \ This deck is also a bit sparse with items for an Occultist, though Archer's Bracers\
  \ and Blood Periapt are solid choices from the start, and picking up the Manual\
  \ of War is almost essential.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\

  \  <br>I've heard whispers of other decks unlocking for Mavaro in the future, so\
  \ stay tuned...\n    </div> \n    <p>That's it for today, my friends. I hope that\
  \ you can forgive my falsehood in my first blog, as I wasn't allowed to talk about\
  \ Mavaro at that point, and Alahazra is an amazing character in all of her versions.\
  \ But when it comes to the <i>best</i> character ever, I am going to have to definitively\
  \ say that it is Mavaro... at least until Lone Shark Games come up with an even\
  \ <i>more</i> amazing character! Until next time!</p> \n    <p style=\"clear: both;\"\
