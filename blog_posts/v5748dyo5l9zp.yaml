  \ 2008 </p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>As for your life and limb I make no promises,\
  \ young novice. Rest assured that you shall never succumb to boredom and your exploits\
  \ will be sung and scripted for the common folk to marvel. <br> —Venture Captain\
  \ Alissa Moldreserva</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>In Part 1, we unveiled our\
  \ first faction, Andoran, and spoke a little about the faction system we'll use\
  \ in Pathfinder Society Organized Play. In Part 2, we unveiled our second faction,\
  \ Cheliax, and we talked briefly about faction prestige, how it's earned, and what\
  \ it means for the world of Golarion as well as what it means for you as a member\
  \ of the Pathfinder Society. For Part 3, we unveil the third faction for Pathfinder\
  \ Society Organized Play: Osirion, Land of the Pharaohs.</p> \n    <p><b>OSIRION</b><br>\
  \ Land of the Pharaohs</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>We must find the strength\
  \ of mountains buried in our past and bring it to bear on those fools who think\
  \ we are nothing but dust in the wind.<br> —Amenopheus, the Sapphire Sage </p> \n\
  \    </blockquote> \n    <p>Osirion was once the most glorious empire of Golarion.\
  \ Pharaohs ruled as gods on earth, their monuments towered over even Thassilon's\
  \ mightiest, and their armies could churn a kingdom to mud and blot out the sun\
  \ on wings of death. Now, Osirion ages from millennia of foreign rule under the\
  \ rulership of the youthful Ruby Prince Khemet III, who hearkens back to the ancient\
  \ days of Osirion's glory. One year ago, Khemet opened the vast deserts of Osirion\
  \ – long closed by the Keleshite overlords who held the nation as a satrapy of Qadira\
  \ – to foreign exploration. Today the great treasures and arcane formulas of the\
  \ living gods of ancient Osirion are unearthed for the entire world to see, and\
  \ the ascendancy of the Land of Pharaohs is at hand. Most Inner Sea nations view\
  \ Osirion as a relic from a bygone age. In truth, Osirion is a slumbering giant\
  \ that, when awakened, could wash away all fledgling challengers with the power\
  \ of its traditions. The Osirion are wise people who look deep into the past for\
  \ answers to present troubles. Their sense of history gives them a unique perspective\
  \ on the ebb and flow of power in the political landscape of the modern Inner Sea.\
  \ Many folk of Osirion are of old Garundi blood, bronze—skinned, and gifted with\
  \ the noble bearing of the ancient pharaohs. It would take a special brand of fool\
  \ to ignore this semblance of power and dismiss the Osirion faction as less of a\
  \ threat than any of the other four factions clamoring for control of Absalom. </p>\

  0\" align=\"right\"></a> \n    <p><b>Goals: Uncover the Power of the Past</b></p>\
  \ \n    <p>In bygone ages, the pharaohs of Ancient Osirion created wonders beyond\
  \ reason. They concocted potent arcane plagues to decimate their enemies and erected\
  \ mighty monuments capable of entrapping the souls of deities. Let the other factions\
  \ jockey for meager political fancy or table scraps like favorable economic sanctions.\
  \ Osirion is interested in rediscovering the powerful artifacts of its heritage,\
  \ and preventing their theft by aggressive powers such as Cheliax. Once these powers\
  \ are returned to their rightful hands, no one shall dare breach Osirion's borders\
  \ again. </p> \n    <p><b>Methodology: Hide Your Power, Lest the Enemy Seek to Take\
  \ It from You</b></p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>The grasping hands of petty thieves\
  \ cannot take what they do not know you have.<br> —Amenopheus, the Sapphire Sage</p>\
  \ \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>For centuries now, the other powers of the Inner\
  \ Sea have regarded Osirion as an impotent nation of conquered people. Osirion wouldn't\
  \ have it any other way. Since the Ruby Prince ascended the ancestral throne a few\
  \ decades past, Osirion has been gathering its power and preparing to make a bid\
  \ for supremacy on the Inner Sea. Most of the Osirion faction's missions involve\
  \ quietly undermining the power of their enemies. Osirion agents in Absalom plant\
  \ the seeds of dissolution with a whisper or a poisonous draught, never with a naked\
  \ blade, and never with a witness. Just as most of the Great Emerald Sphinx is buried\
  \ beneath the sands of Osirion's deserts, so is the nation's power carefully hidden\
  \ in secret brotherhoods and spies loyal to the pharaonic throne. When Absalom sits\
  \ firmly in Osirion's grasp, then Khemet III shall declare himself Pharaoh in the\
  \ tradition of his ancestors and Osirion's Second Golden Age shall follow. </p>\
