  artist: "using Combat Expertise, which at his level gives him a +4 dodge bonus to\
    \ his AC (which also adds to his Combat Maneuver Defense, but more on that later)\
    \ but taking a –4 penalty on attack rolls for 1 round. He can also used Power\
    \ Attack to add +8 damage on attacks made with his longsword and +4 damage on\
    \ attacks made with his shortsword by taking an additional –4 penalty on attack\
    \ rolls. He would probably not want to use both at the same time, but he can mix\
    \ it up as dictated by the situation. If he manages to hit one target with both\
    \ his longsword and shortsword in the same round, he deals an additional 1d10+4\
    \ points of damage thanks to Two-Weapon Rend. All of this assumes that Valeros\
    \ begins his turn adjacent to an enemy. If not, he can charge up and make a single\
    \ attack with his longsword using both Power Attack and Improved Vital Strike.\
    \ This devastating attack is made at a +23 bonus and it deals 3d8+21. Note that\
    \ Valeros can move 30 feet during this charge, despite wearing a breastplate.\
    \ This is due to his armor training, which allows him to move at full speed while\
    \ wearing such armor. You might notice a new statistic in Valeros' stat block.\
    \ CMD, which stands for Combat Maneuver Defense. This statistic is the DC for\
    \ anyone else to perform a combat maneuver, such as bull rush, disarm, or grapple,\
    \ against Valeros. This statistic is derived"
