  artist: "picking to Character Traits your character effectively starts with a bonus\
    \ feat that's tailored specifically to his or her background and personality.\
    \ Today, I'd like to preview what traits look like. Presented below are five of\
    \ the ten Combat traits. These traits comprise a small portion of the 40 basic\
    \ traits presented in the Second Darkness Player's Guide, and represent generic\
    \ traits that you can pick"
