  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">Thursday, July 30, 2009</p> \n    <p>Shameful! Absolutely\
  \ shameful!</p> \n    <p>I refer, of course, to the fact that the last several months\
  \ have seen the Planet Stories footprint on this blog dwindle down to almost nothing.\
  \ It turns out that producing a 576-page RPG core rulebook and a bestiary with more\
  \ than 350 monsters <i>in addition</i> to our Pathfinder, Pathfinder Companion,\
  \ Pathfinder Chronicles, Pathfinder Modules, Pathfinder Scenarios, GameMastery,\
  \ Titanic, and Planet Stories lines is a bit time-consuming. (Just reading over\
  \ that list makes me want to hide under my desk and take a nap.)</p> \n    <p>But\
  \ those days of slothful negligence are past! The classic SF of Planet Stories will\
  \ once again shine forth from this blog, and given our total artistic redesign of\
  \ the line, there's never been a better time for it. In the coming weeks, we'll\
  \ be talking more about <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy83xa\"><i>Robots Have\
  \ No Tails</i></a> by Henry Kuttner, the first book in the new format, as well as\
  \ its introduction by weird-fiction superstar Tim Powers and Kuttner praise from\
  \ H. P. Lovecraft himself, plus subscription benefits and the philosophy behind\
  \ the new look for the line. For now, however, I'm happy to let Mr. Kuttner speak\
  \ for himself. The following excerpt is from the <a href=\"/planetStories/v5748btpy83xa\"\
  ><i>Robots Have No Tails</i></a> story \"The World is Mine,\" in which our drunken\
  \ scientist hero attempts to solve his own murder while wrangling three adorable\
  \ and incompetent martians bent on planetary conquest...</p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p>\"The little guys came through the machine or whatever it was. You said\
  \ you hadn't adjusted it right, so you fixed it.\"</p> \n     <p>\"I wonder what\
  \ I had in mind,\" Gallegher pondered.</p> \n     <p>The Lybblas had finished their\
  \ milk. \"We're through,\" said the fat one. \"Now we'll conquer the world. Where'll\
  \ we begin?\"</p> \n     <p>Gallegher shrugged, \"I fear I can't advise you, gentlemen.\
  \ I've never had the inclination myself. Wouldn't have the faintest idea how to\
  \ go about it.\"</p> \n     <p>\"First we destroy the big cities,\" said the smallest\
  \ Lybbla excitedly, \"then we capture pretty girls and hold them for ransom or something.\
  \ Then everybody's scared and we win.\"</p> \n     <p>\"How do you figure that out?\"\
  \ Gallegher asked.</p> \n     <p>\"It's in the books. That's how it's always done.\
  \ We know. We'll be tyrants and beat everybody. I want some more milk, please.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"So do I,\" said two other piping little voices.</p> \n     <p>Grinning,\
  \ Gallegher served. \"You don't seem much surprised by finding yourselves here.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"That's in the books, too.\" <i>Lap-lap.</i></p> \n     <p>\"You\
  \ mean—this?\" Gallegher's eyebrows went up.</p> \n     <p>\"Oh, no. But all about\
  \ time-traveling. All the novels in our era are about science and things. We read\
  \ lots. There isn't much else to do in the Valley,\" the Lybbla ended, a bit sadly.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Is that all you read?\"</p> \n     <p>\"No, we read everything. Technical\
  \ books on science as well as novels. How disintegrators are made and so on. We'll\
  \ tell you how to make weapons for us.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Thanks. That sort of literature\
  \ is open to the public?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Sure. Why not?\"</p> \n     <p>\"I should\
  \ think it would be dangerous.\"</p> \n     <p>\"So should I,\" the fat Lybbla said\
  \ thoughtfully, \"but it isn't somehow.\"</p> \n     <p>Gallegher pondered. \"Could\
  \ you tell me how to make a heat ray, for example?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Yes,\" was\
  \ the excited reply, \"and then we'd destroy the big cities and capture—\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"I know. Pretty girls and hold them for ransom. Why?\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  We know what's what,\" a Lybbla said shrewdly. \"We read books, we do.\" He spilled\
  \ his cup, looked at the puddle of milk, and let his ears droop disconsolately.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The other two Lybblas hastily patted him on the back. \"Don't cry,\"\
  \ the biggest one urged.</p> \n     <p>\"I gotta,\" the Lybbla said. \"It's in the\
  \ books.\"</p> \n     <p>\"You have it backward. You <i>don't</i> cry over spilt\
  \ milk.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Do. Will,\" said the recalcitrant Lybbla, and began to\
  \ weep.</p> \n     <p>Gallegher brought him more milk. \"About this heat ray,\"\
  \ he said. \"Just how—\"</p> \n     <p> \"Simple,\" the fat Lybbla said, and explained.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>It <i>was</i> simple. Grandpa didn't get it, of course, but he watched\
  \ interestedly as Gallegher went to work. Within half an hour the job was completed.\
  \ It was a heat ray, too. It burned a hole through a closet door.</p> \n     <p><i>\"\
  Whew!\"</i> Gallegher breathed, watching smoke rise from the charred wood. \"That's\
  \ something!\" He examined the small metal cylinder in his hand.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  It kills people, too,\" the fat Lybbla murmured. \"Like the man in the back yard.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"Yes, it— What? The man in—\"</p> \n     <p>\"The back yard. We\
  \ sat on him for a while, but he got cold after a bit. There's a hole burned through\
  \ his chest.\"</p> \n     <p>\"You did it,\" Gallegher accused, gulping.</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"No. He came out of time, too, I expect. There was a heat-ray hole in\
  \ him.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Who...who was he?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Never saw him before\
  \ in my life,\" the fat Lybbla said, losing interest. \"I want more milk.\" He leaped\
  \ to the bench top and peered through the window at the towers of Manhattan's skyline.\
  \ \"<i>Wheeee!</i> The world is ours!\"</p> \n     <p>The doorbell sang. Gallegher,\
  \ a little pale said, \"Grandpa, see what it is. Send him away in any case. Probably\
  \ a bill collector. They're used to being turned away. Oh, Lord! I've never committed\
  \ a murder before—\"</p> \n     <p>\"I have,\" Grandpa murmured, departing. He did\
  \ not clarify the statement.</p> \n     <p>Gallegher went into the back yard, accompanied\
  \ by the scuttling small figures of the Lybblas. The worst had happened. In the\
  \ middle of the rose garden lay a dead body. It was the corpse of a man, bearded\
  \ and ancient, quite bald, and wearing garments made, apparently of flexible, tinted\
  \ cellophane. Through his tunic and chest was the distinctive hole burned by a heat-ray\
  \ projector.</p> \n     <p>\"He looks familiar, somehow,\" Gallegher decided. \"\
  Dunno why. Was he dead when he came out of time?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Dead but warm,\"\
  \ one of the Lybblas said. \"That was nice.\"</p> \n     <p>Gallegher repressed\
  \ a shudder. Horrid little creatures...</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>James Sutter\
