  \ or Emancipation Day, celebrates June 19, 1865, the day when the last slaves in\
  \ the United States were finally informed they were free. The road from the first\
  \ Juneteenth to today wasn’t smooth or easy. Last year, I wrote a blog about the\
  \ history of Juneteenth, which you can find <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh9k?Happy-Juneteenth\"\
  >here</a>, but this year, I wanted to talk a bit about what we can do on Juneteenth\
  \ now, in the present day, and in the future.</p> \n     <p>So, how can we celebrate\
  \ Juneteenth? How do we commemorate a day fraught with so much pain and suffering?\
  \ One of the best ways we can celebrate Emancipation Day is by educating ourselves\
  \ about the history of our country that we didn't learn about in school. The contributions\
  \ of Black people to every aspect of our nation, be it socially, culturally, philosophically,\
  \ or technologically, are tremendous. Thankfully, there are lot of resources out\
  \ there! Annually, <a href=\"https://www.juneteenthny.com/\" target=\"_blank\">New\
  \ York hosts a 3-day Juneteenth summit</a> with talent shows, health and wellness\
  \ screenings, educational activities and more. This year, like last year, the summit\
  \ is online, making it accessible regardless of location. Likewise, this year, the\
  \ <a href=\"https://nmaahc.si.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Smithsonian Museum of African\
  \ American History and Culture</a> presents programming that highlights both the\
  \ history of the holiday and stories of the people who lived it. </p> \n     <p>Another\
  \ way we can celebrate the holiday is by going out and supporting Black businesses.\
  \ Buy a gift from a marginalized creator. Eat at a Black-owned restaurant. Many\
  \ organizations maintain lists of local businesses owned by Black proprietors—here\
  \ in Seattle, we have the Seattle Good Business Network, so check to see if a similar\
  \ resource exists for your area! On a larger scale, the US Chamber of Commerce wrote\
  \ an article featuring 8 rosters of Black businesses.</p> \n     <p>Our own industry,\
  \ tabletop RPGs, has its own history of erased Black innovators, creators, and personalities.\
  \ We can help reform the industry by learning about Black people in the industry\
  \ and the ways they influence and shape not just the games we love, but the communities\
  \ we participate in. There are a number of games and settings being made by Black\
  \ creators right now. Look at them, learn about them, talk about them with your\
  \ friends, engage with them, and if you're making them, keep making them! One I've\
  \ been following recently is <a href=\"https://motherlandsrpg.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\

  >Congress moved to make Juneteenth a national holiday</a>, something it should have\
  \ been since 1865. At this point, it needs President Biden’s signature, and it is\
  \ likely that in the next few days this will occur (Update: it did! Juneteenth is\
  \ now a national holiday!). That’s an important thing, but it is also important\
  \ to remember that we have to go beyond just performance. Our country still struggles\
  \ with not just the legacy of slavery, but ongoing slavery and systemic racism in\
  \ the form of our prison and economic systems. Commemorating one of the most important\
  \ days in our nation’s history with a national holiday is a valuable first step\
  \ in moving forward, be we can’t let it be a symbol of the defeat of racism, or\
  \ let it convince us that the injustices, the horrors, inflicted on the Black community\
  \ are behind us, because neither of those things are true. When the holiday is past,\
  \ we should keep doing the things we did during it: keep pushing for change, keep\
  \ demanding justice, keep supporting Black businesses, and keep learning.</p> \n\
