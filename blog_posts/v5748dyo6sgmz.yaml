  \ itemprop=\"description\">May is a busy time for us Paizonians, with convention\
  \ season ramping up and PaizoCon just around the corner, there's so much to do!\
  \ One thing I always look forward to at this time of year is the Mox Gauntlet, and\
  \ it's coming up <strong><em>THIS SUNDAY</em></strong>!</p> \n    <p>Each year,\
  \ the folks at <a href=\"https://www.moxboardinghouse.com/engage/\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >ENGAGE</a> bring together up to 20 teams from local gaming companies for an all-day\
  \ charity boardgame tournament to raise funds for and bring awareness to a non-profit\
  \ organization that directly affects our community. This year, proceeds are going\
  \ to <a href=\"http://www.elcentrodelaraza.org/\" target=\"_blank\">El Centro de\
  \ la Raza</a>, an organization dedicated to building unity across racial and economic\
  \ sectors, as well as empowering the most vulnerable and marginalized populations.\
  \ From education and youth-focused programs to community building and development,\
  \ they strive to offer aid to the Seattle community and beyond. Each $100 donated\
  \ to the Gauntlet provides an hour of after-school programming for low-income middle\
  \ school students with comprehensive academic support and pro-social activities.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>I am very proud to be captain of Team Paizo for the 2nd year in a row,\
  \ and what a great team we have this year! We've got Pathfinder Developer Ron Lundeen,\
  \ Starfinder Developer Joe Pasini, and System Administrator Whitney Chatterjee on\
  \ board to kick butt at board games and raise money for kids. Plus, rumor has it\
  \ that Whitney is working on a pretty awesome costume to fit with this year's vintage\
  \ circus theme! Only two games have been announced, and we've been practicing as\
  \ much as we can. There's <em>Photosynthesis</em>, a beautiful board game where\
  \ you play as trees and try to grow yourself a mighty forest. Then there's P<em>arade</em>,\
  \ an Alice in Wonderland themed card game where the goal is to get the least amount\
  \ of points. There will be a trivia round, as well as a mystery game which we'll\
  \ have to learn and play on the day of the event. In the past, these have been anything\
  \ from entirely made up games, to full-on puzzle-solving, clue-finding, puzzle room.\
  \ Anything goes!</p> \n    <p>If you're interested in watching the shenanigans go\
  \ down, there are a couple of ways you can do that. If you're local, Mox Boardinghouse\
  \ in Bellevue will have plenty of fun in-house activities going on that day for\
  \ anybody who wishes to come down and join us, including games and raffles! Don't\
  \ worry if you're more remote, the entire event will be <a href=\"https://twitch.tv/cardkingdom\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">live-streamed on Twitch</a>. Donations are open through the\
  \ end of the event, and not only do they help the cause, but they also give Team\
  \ Paizo a shot at awesome power-ups which will help us gain an edge in the games.\
  \ Please feel free to browse and share <a href=\"https://thegauntlet2019.causevox.com/team/Paizo\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">Paizo's team page</a>.</p> \n    <p>We are incredibly grateful\
  \ for everyone who makes this event possible, and for those who donate to benefit\
  \ El Centro de la Raza. Thanks so much, and we'll see you this Sunday!</p> \n  \
