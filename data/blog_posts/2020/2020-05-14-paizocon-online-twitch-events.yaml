                <h3>Sunday, May 31</h3>
                <h4>PaizoCon Closing Ceremonies (12-1 p.m.)</h4>
                <p>All good things must come to an end, and so must we close the curtains on PaizoCon Online 2020. Join Paizo and Know Direction staffers as we look back at the event and give thanks to all of the amazing contributors, volunteers, partners, and you for making PaizoCon Online an event to remember.</p>
                <h4>Live Play: QueueTimes - Shadow of Norgober (PF2E; 4:30-7:30)</h4>
                <p>A string of gruesome murders, five mysterious notes, and one long forgotten friend inspires five retired adventurers to band together one last time. As they look for the one responsible behind the killings, they’re each forced to confront their past actions, before their days of fame and glory, in order to save the kingdom.</p>
