  >Play games. Heal kids. That's what Uncle's Games set out to do when we partnered\
  \ with Paizo and others to throw one of the biggest Extra Life board gaming events\
  \ in the nation. Over 200 people descended upon Redmond Town Center in Washington\
  \ state with the goal of playing games for 25 hours straight. For each hour they\
  \ gamed, their friends and family donated money to Seattle Children's Hospital.</span></p>\

  \     </div> \n     <p>Uncle's Games joined with Paizo, the hit web-series Tabletop,\
  \ and many other publishers and game designers to create a gaming experience similar\
  \ to that which you would typically find at a convention. The Pathfinder Society\
  \ gamers began showing up an hour before the event was scheduled to start, full\
  \ of enthusiasm for a marathon of roleplaying. Throughout the day other gamers came\
  \ and went in waves with everyone participating in the awesome cause of playing\
  \ games to help heal kids.</p> \n     <p>Boyan Radakovich, producer of Geek &amp;\
  \ Sundry's Tabletop, flew out to participate in the festivities. His goal: to beat\
  \ Wil Wheaton's Season 2 win record by playing through the same games, in order.\
  \ His table was full throughout the entire 15 hours it took him to play through\
  \ all of Season 2. Ultimately, Wil's honor was defended as Boyan ended with the\
  \ same win record, 2 wins out of 11 games.</p> \n     <p>Thanks to the generous\
  \ support of Paizo and many other game industry folks, this Extra Life event featured\
  \ a silent auction. There were four full tables of games and geeky items to bid\
  \ on. The first table was full of games that had been signed by designers and famous\
  \ people. These items included a Pathfinder RPG bag with a retail value over $300\
  \ signed by the entire team at Paizo, Star Trek Catan signed by Wil Wheaton &amp;\
  \ Jeri Ryan, and a whole host of other items.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ the hope of raising $1000 for Seattle Children's Hospital, but with the fantastic\
  \ support of our gaming community, we were able to raise over $3000 for Seattle\
  \ Children's Hospital!</p> \n     <p>While our event was a success, in that we had\
  \ a ton of fun playing games with our community, the even bigger win is the record-breaking\
  \ $3.8 million raised by Extra Life participants across the globe! We can't wait\
  \ to do it all again next year!</p> \n    </div> \n   </blockquote> <!-- tags: Charity\
