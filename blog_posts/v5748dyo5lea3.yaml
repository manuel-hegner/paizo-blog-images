  \ 21, 2012</p> \n    <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n     <p><i>\"Loooviiing yoooouuu...is\
  \ easy 'cause you're beauuuuutiful. Doo dooo doodoo. Aaaaaaiiiiiiii\"</i></p> \n\
  \     <p>Ahem. It isn't always this easy.</p> \n     <p>The height of a freelancer's\
  \ satisfaction on any given project is often mute and unheralded. When a project\
  \ is finally turned over, dutifully and painstakingly crafted over the course of\
  \ months, only your developer, and perhaps your long-suffering spouse, are the ones\
  \ who even know. In other words, the echo of popping champagne corks isn't commonly\
  \ experienced by your typical RPG designer. Since you can't say anything, by the\
  \ time a project does reach the public eye, from the initial murmurs of messageboard\
  \ excitement to the dramatic unveiling of the finished product, you've usually moved\
  \ well beyond the groundswell, that special creative place in your brain long-since\
  \ vacated and re-inhabited with new assignments. And since words are cheap and art\
  \ isn't, you're often surprised to find things have changed significantly since\
  \ you last saw them, adapted to fit the artist depictions that aren't always what\
  \ you remember describing. So when the gaming world starts to get excited, you often\
  \ have to flip through along with everyone else, read what's become of your orphaned\
  \ ideas, and figure it out all over again.</p> \n     <p>But then there's that rare\
  \ time in a freelancer's life, particularly when you've cultivated a great relationship\
  \ with your publisher and regularly attend the same conventions, when your excitement\
  \ never quite gets a chance to quell, because they keep stoking those fires that\
  \ got you so excited to work on a project in the first place. Most recently, Paizo\
  \ has facilitated this with a growing list of awesome tie-in products unveiled at\
  \ various stages of development, most of which stand a good chance of possessing\
  \ snippets of your game design. With the introduction of the Wizkids' partnership\
  \ with Paizo, this opens up intriguing new possibilities to see fantastic 3-dimensional\
  \ depictions of your work, something I've always wanted to experience. Which is\
  \ how I remember so vividly the first time I saw the Clockwork Reliquary.</p> \n\
  \     <div class=\"blurb180\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20121221-Concept.jpg\"\

  \     <p>The chance to revisit Azlanti technology was the reason I immediately jumped\
  \ when I saw the outline for <a href=\"/products/btpy8tvr\"><i>The Dead Heart of\
  \ Xin</i></a>. I had set myself up for this chance years earlier in some of my first\
  \ works for Paizo: <a href=\"/products/btpy8evj\"><i>From Shore to Sea</i></a>,\
  \ and later the Sun Temple colony in <a href=\"/products/btpy8i8t\"><i>Lost Cities\
  \ of Golarion</i></a>. But nearly all the Azlanti devices PCs experienced in those\
  \ products were dormant or malfunctioning, only providing the merest hint of the\
  \ incredible power wielded by Golarion's first advanced civilization. Given the\
  \ chance to see some of that stuff working as it should, all set in the hallowed\
  \ halls of the palace stronghold of Rune Magic's inventor and a true master of those\
  \ arcane arts? Well... I could barely contain myself.</p> \n     <p>It wasn't long\
  \ after I finished crafting the adventure (and turned over a month early, at that!)\
  \ that I flew to Seattle for PaizoCon 2012, and visited a recently-transplanted\
  \ Daigle and the rest of the crew at the offices. As usual for a working freelancer,\
  \ most talk is on upcoming projects, but James and Erik called me over for a special\
  \ little surprise: the initial sketches for the Clockwork Reliquary. I had worked\
  \ hard to realize James' outline notes into a terrifying mechanical monstrosity\
  \ that was at once ancient and advanced. As you'll see when the adventure arrives\
  \ next month, I had settled on a technological design aesthetic inspired by the\
  \ skeksis architecture and weaponry from <i>The Dark Crystal</i>. As a result, I\
  \ remember having the most trouble with headless design and top-mounted arms the\
  \ outline tentatively described, as I desperately wanted to avoid a \"helicopter-head\"\
  \ creature. I even sketched it out myself as part of my turnover in a bid to prevent\
  \ that depiction, in an almost-embarrassing drawing with more spidery legs that\
  \ turned out surprisingly close to the finished rendition (admittedly done well\
  \ before I knew who the cover artist would be, but shown here for your snickering\
  \ amusement). I was really concerned with having the BBEG of the AP invoke the same\
  \ kind of mind-numbing fear when you see a really good human-versus-dragon illustration.\
  \ You look at it and and wonder <i>\"how in the world could a real person even survive\
  \ for a <b>second</b> against that thing?\"</i> Not that my sketch depicts <i>that</i>,\
  \ but I'm not an artist, and I <i>was</i> trying.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb180\"\

  \    </div> \n     <p>Of course, it doesn't hurt when you've got the master himself—\
  Wayne Reynolds—working toward the same goal. When I'd heard Wayne was the cover\
  \ artist, I was immediately embarrassed for my presumptions to do my own sketches,\
  \ and I remember sheepishly asking Wayne at PaizoCon if he'd seen that terrible\
  \ thing (mercifully he had not). But even without the visual reference, words and\
  \ art connected perfectly through the descriptions he'd been provided, because his\
  \ pencils sent shivers up my spine in a way I'd never experienced in seeing my work\
  \ realized in two-dimensions—and I've seen a lot. The gangly arms were spot-on.\
  \ The stilted legs. The clawed hands. The skymetal construction. The crystal coffin.\
  \ (Fun Fact: 4 arms + 3 legs=7 limbs corresponding with Seven Virtues of Rule!)\
  \ Most of all I appreciated the noticeable lack of too many gears. Despite my early\
  \ enthusiasm for the steampunk genre and the creature's name, I never wanted this\
  \ adventure to delve into that aesthetic, and, in fact, I had tried to skip gears\
  \ entirely in my early designs which called for the various joints to be bonded\
  \ not quite by clockwork, but by mini-miasmas of arcane energy. You can still see\
  \ a hint of that attempt in my sketch, which would allow its individual limbs to\
  \ orbit its body in weird magic ball-and-socket joints and prevent my \"helicopter-head\"\
  \ dread, and it kept with my established Azlanti-stuff-always-orbits themes. Sure,\
  \ I would liked to have seen a burnt-black skeleton and a transparent-green noqual\
  \ crystal as originally designed, but those concerns vanished with the way Wayne\
  \ conveyed the maliciousness of a partial skeleton without eyes or flesh to work\
  \ with was just perfect, and the sloping, arched-back shoulders of its four clawed\
  \ arms just conveyed the terrifying power of this mechanical horror. It was so...\
  \ <i>antediluvian</i>... so... <i>perfect.</i> Truly an imperial monstrosity capable\
  \ of leading a clockwork army to world domination!</p> \n     <p>But there was more!\
  \ I think while James and I just sort of oo-ed and ah-ed and nodded in wide-eyed\
  \ unison over just how perfect the depiction was, Erik tugged on my sleeve and led\
  \ me—stunned and glassy-eyed—to his office, where he revealed that not only would\
  \ Wizkids and Paizo be producing an accompanying miniature line for Shattered Star,\
  \ but production was well underway... AND the Clockwork Reliquary would be one of\
  \ them AND... well, he showed me the initial sculpt.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  0\"></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Like many Paizo fans, I grew up surrounded by action\
  \ figures. Now as then, I've always been fascinated by a world in miniature. Star\
  \ Wars was, of course, my first introduction, but I recall my first RPG purchase\
  \ was a Ral Partha beholder mini when I was only 7 or 8 years old. Hundreds more\
  \ followed. Scaled down, I could lord over these tiny figures like some deranged\
  \ deity, a habit I'm afraid has never subsided in adulthood, as I still have an\
  \ unhealthy habit for minis. And as I'd grown up chopping up and rearranging figures\
  \ into variations that matched my imagination's own ideas—I remember a Ithorian\
  \ head superglued to Obi-Wan's body as a \"Hammerhead-Jedi-Knight-Bounty-Hunter\"\
  \ being a particular favorite—seeing something I'd imagined brought into the world\
  \ in 3-dimensions was always some secret passion of mine. So imagine the thrill\
  \ of seeing one of your creations actualized in the real world! Here we had a hunch\
  \ nestled in James' head for years, entrusted to me to flesh out and build in imaginative\
  \ words, descriptions, and statistics, then passed on the an incredible artist to\
  \ realize in two-dimensions, and, finally, passed on to another artist—this time\
  \ a sculptor—to realize in a third. I was speechless. Just as Wayne Reynolds had\
  \ realized nearly every nuance of my Clockwork Reliquary designs, so, too, did the\
  \ sculptor at WizKids realize every nuance of his concept drawing. The gangly-yet-powerful\
  \ skymetal frame. Those oddly hunched shoulders that reminded me of the cocked hammer\
  \ of a gun ready to fire. The howling skeleton encased in super-cool transparent\
  \ epoxy. Those misleadingly dainty legs. The great details of Azlanti glyphs and\
  \ Thassilonian runes and the ribcage-like reservoir and the scrolls flapping in\
  \ the breeze and... *gasp.* I marveled, as your PCs soon will, at the sheer <i>power</i>\
  \ of a reborn tyrant hellbent on reclaiming a kingdom lost 100 centuries before.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Just as I'd struggled in design with the Clockwork Reliquary's size\
  \ before striking the right balance, so, too, does this mini take advantage of the\
  \ best of both worlds. On paper, Large didn't seem quite imposing enough, and Huge\
  \ didn't seem to fit the dimensions of a cradled skeleton and the gangly, whirling-dervish\
  \ agility I wanted to convey for Xin's penultimate creation. As a result of those\
  \ design assumptions, this mini is by far one of the largest Larges I've ever handled,\
  \ suitably imposing and towering over PCs at just under 4-inches. Since the reliquary's\
  \ longer arms are about 3 inches from shoulder to claw-tip, and <i>bent</i> at that,\
  \ I'd say this mini gets the \"gangly\" theme I so wanted to convey down! The internal\
  \ skeleton is fairly big in relative scale, but since <i>The Dead Heart of Xin</i>\
  \ allows you to actually witness Xin's final moments, it isn't hard to assume that\
  \ maybe the old emperor was maybe under the influence of <i>enlarge person</i> or\
  \ other arcane augmentation, or we're simply seeing the distortion of the eldritch-warped\
  \ crystal coffin. This was one bad dude, so anything's possible!</p> \n     <p><span\
  \ itemprop=\"description\">So here it is, Paizo fans! The Clockwork Reliquary, finally\
  \ unveiled after 10,000 years of slumber, risen from the waves and ruins of Thassilon\
  \ to claim the lives of your PCs before moving onward to world domination at the\
  \ head of its clockwork army! Can they stop it, or will all of Golarion once again\
  \ kneel before the skymetal tyrant? Erik was right last week when he called this\
  \ figure \"the coolest mini in the whole set, possibly the most complex and awesome-est\
  \ prepainted plastic mini ever made for any set.\" I couldn't agree more, and I\
  \ know your wait was worth it.</span></p> \n     <p>The Clockwork Reliquary is the\
  \ primary villain of the Shattered Star Adventure Path's final chapter, <a href=\"\
