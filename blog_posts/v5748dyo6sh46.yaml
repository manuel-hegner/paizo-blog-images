  ></a> \n     </div> \n     <p>The details of this campaign are classified. Therefore,\
  \ in preparation for this or any mystery campaign, I’ve scoured the Starfinder archive\
  \ to collate some general advice and inspiration you.</p> \n     <p>Let’s set the\
  \ stage with an excerpt from the six-page article <i>Mystery Adventures</i> by Jason\
  \ Keeley in volume one of the Starfinder Adventure Path #25: <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq022bl?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-25-The-Chimera-Mystery\"\
  ><i>The Chimera Mystery</i></a>.</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p><i>“You see,\
  \ Mrs. Braintner, only you have knowledge of the rare poison that was found coursing\
  \ through Count Correndo’s veins, only you were seen leaving the hedge maze on the\
  \ night of the crime, and only you were aware of the last-minute change to the count’\
  s will in which you wouldn’t have received a solitary credit. You had the means,\
  \ the opportunity, and the motive. Those are the facts, and there’s no use in saying\
  \ otherwise. Therefore, only you could have committed this heinous murder! Ghenkins,\
  \ if you would be so kind as to escort this cold-blooded killer to the police hovervan\
  \ waiting outside?”<br> —excerpt from the popular weekly holovid “Detective Death”\
  </i></p> \n      <h3>A MYSTERY’S THREE PILLARS</h3> \n      <p>Whether the mystery\
  \ occurs on a high-tech space station or in a colony settlement on a backwater planet,\
  \ the culprit has a means, motive, and opportunity to commit the crime. Some suspects\
  \ might have one or two of these elements. However, the true criminal must have\
  \ all three.</p> \n      <h4>MEANS</h4> \n      <p>A suspect has the means to commit\
  \ a crime if they are physically able to do so. Could they reliable fire a pistol\
  \ to kill the victim with one shot? Are they dexterous enough to reach the only\
  \ window that showed signs it was forced open? Do they have the knowledge to be\
  \ able to create a malignant computer virus?</p> \n      <p>Some crimes are simple\
  \ enough that all suspects could conceivably have the means to commit them. Other\
  \ times, the means by which a crime was committed are unknown or indefinite. In\
  \ such cases, discovering the culprit’s motive and opportunity becomes even more\
  \ important. However, knowing that a suspect couldn’t possibly have had the means\
  \ to perpetuate the crime is probably the easiest way to eliminate them from the\
  \ list.</p> \n      <h4>MOTIVE</h4> \n      <p>A suspect’s motive for committing\
  \ the crime should be compelling enough for them to want to break the law or at\
  \ least act outside norms. Might they inherit a large estate when the victim passes\
  \ away? Are they trying to keep the victim from revealing a devastating secret?\
  \ Did they fly into a fit of rage at the mention of some past misdeed?</p> \n  \
  \    <p>No criminal acts without a motive, even if the motive has little connection\
  \ to reality. Money and love are common motives in classic mysteries. Motives might\
  \ abound in a mystery adventure, and should in a good one. Then, it’s up to the\
  \ investigators to determine which of the possibilities is strong enough to warrant\
  \ the perpetrator’s actions.</p> \n      <h4>OPPORTUNITY</h4> \n      <p>A suspect\
  \ has the opportunity to commit a crime if they could have been at the location\
  \ of the crime at the correct time. Were they having dinner with a large group of\
  \ people at the time of the incident? Did they redeem a fare for public transportation\
  \ in a city hundreds of miles away? Do the security logs show them entering the\
  \ restricted building before the crime occurred?</p> \n      <p>Most perpetrators\
  \ try to have an alibi for when the crime happened. It’s important for it to seem\
  \ like they had no opportunity to perform the deed. Investigators need to sort through\
  \ the alibis to discover which are true.</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>You\
