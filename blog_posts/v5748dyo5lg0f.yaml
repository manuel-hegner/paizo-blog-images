  \ Legends: A Visual Companion</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Sunday, April 6, 2014</p>\
  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Right\
  \ after the debut <a href=\"/store/byCompany/b/bigFinish\">Pathfinder Legends</a>\
  \ full-cast audio drama was released, my wife and I got stuck in an unexpected traffic\
  \ snarl (which shouldn't have been too surprising, living in Seattle, and all).\
  \ To kill the time, I put on the CD, and my wife—Shelyn bless her—obliged me by\
  \ listening. It didn't take very long before she was getting into the story and\
  \ following closely. There were a few instances when she made me pause playback,\
  \ however, so that I could explain what certain locations, creatures, and characters\
  \ looked like. It hit me then that not everyone listening to Pathfinder Legends\
  \ may play Pathfinder or be familiar with some of the fantasy tropes that those\
  \ of us who've been playing D&amp;D or variants thereof for decades can sometimes\
  \ take for granted. One of the reasons the audio drama is so captivating is that\
  \ it doesn't include a lot of exposition dumps or narration, meaning some of the\
  \ physical descriptions one might expect in a novel or RPG experience just aren't\
  \ there.</span></p> \n    <p>Thus, I put together this quick visual guide for listeners\
  \ new to the Pathfinder universe to aid you in acclimating to some of the elements\
  \ encountered in Burn Offerings. The following images and descriptions could be\
  \ considered a spoiler, so if you aren't familiar with the Burnt Offerings story,\
  \ I recommend scrolling down the page as you're listening to the audio drama.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>First up we have the town of Sandpoint, where the adventure begins. This\
  \ is a settlement of about 1,200 people in the nation of Varisia, in a coastal wilderness\
  \ region known as the Lost Coast.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a\

  \ border=\"0\"></a> \n     <br>Illustration by Noah Bradley\n    </div> \n    <p>Among\
  \ the personalities the heroes encounter during the Swallowtail Festival are Mayor\
  \ Kendra Deverin, Sheriff Belor Hemlock, and Lonjiku Kaijitsu (all pictured below).</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/PZO1002_KendraDeverin.jpg\"\

  \   </div> \n    <p>Lonjiku's daughter, Ameiko, has a prominent role in the adventure,\
  \ serving as their hostess at the Rusty Dragon, Sandpoint's finest inn and tavern\
  \ (she appears on the cover of the third Pathfinder Legends release, <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy91vq\"><i>The Hook Mountain Massacre</i></a>). Her half-brother, Tsuto,\
  \ also makes an appearance. It's pretty clear from the dialogue in the audio drama\
  \ that he's a half-elf—here's what he looks like. </p>\n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/PZO1002_TsutoKaijitsu.jpg\"\

  \ border=\"0\"></a> \n     <br>Illustration by Eric Belisle\n    </div> \n    <p>One\
  \ of my wife's most pressing questions toward the end of the adventure was, “what's\
  \ a bugbear?” The character Bruthazmus plays a large role in the adventure's conclusion,\
  \ as does his boss, Nualia Tobyn. They're both depicted here. He's a large-yet-sneaky\
  \ goblinoid (bugbear), while she's a demon-tainted human with angelic ancestry (making\
  \ her both beautiful and ugly at the same time).</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  > <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderAdventurePath/PZO1002_Bruthazmus.jpg\"> <img\

  \    <p>That should take you right up to the adventure's end. Does having images\
  \ to accompany the audio heighten your listening experience? We can't add visuals\
  \ to the audio itself, but if this is the sort of thing listeners like, we may make\
  \ a habit of this sort of blog for future Pathfinder Legends releases. Comment on\
  \ this blog and let us know your thoughts, both about this visual companion as well\
  \ as Pathfinder Legends in general.</p> \n    <p>Mark Moreland<br> <i>Developer</i></p>\
