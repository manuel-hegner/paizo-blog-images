  \ There are spoilers aplenty in this report. (Maybe just look at the awesome pictures\
  \ if you're playing through this.)</p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p>Going into\
  \ volume four of the Ruins of Azlant Adventure Path, we had a couple of pieces of\
  \ information about what lay ahead; these included following a lead about a veiled\
  \ master, and knowing that we were headed to the underwater city of Talasantri.\
  \ We originally scheduled our usual four-day run, but during play we endeared ourselves\
  \ to the city and adjusted our schedules to make this a slow-burning marathon of\
  \ nearly a week, culminating with fireworks and food on the 4th of July!</p> \n\

  \ \n      <p>To create immersion for our visit to an underwater city, we surrounded\
  \ our play area with a 360-degree panorama of undersea scenes matching the coral\
  \ streets of Talasantri (including a merfolk evocative of many we'd encounter).\
  \ To capture the effect of jellyfish lanterns lighting the city, we employed string\
  \ lights of appropriate colors, along with sparkling underwater lighting effects\
  \ from our local Halloween store. As we toured establishments in the city, we were\
  \ enraptured by music from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhJLO5pFKTI\"\
  >Aquasonic</a>, played completely underwater. Lastly, our tabletop itself glimmered\
  \ with the craftsmanship of both <a href=\"http://bluetablepainting.com/\">Blue\
  \ Table Painting</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BlackBardStudios/\"\
  >Black Bard Studios</a>, who helped bring Talasantri to life for us.</p> \n    \
  \  <ul> \n       <li>Adventure: Pathfinder Adventure Path #124: City in the Deep</li>\
  \ \n       <li>Marathon Length: 125 hours, 50min</li> \n       <li>Session Hours:\
  \ 60hrs, 15min</li> \n      </ul> \n      <h2>Highlights From \"City in the Deep\"\
  </h2> \n      <ul> \n       <li>Our biggest concern was how it was going to play\
  \ out being underwater for so long. Matt, a veteran of the Order and our \"Player\
  \ Captain Emeritus,\" supervised the party's toolkit for underwater adventuring.\
  \ He made it so that we were able to enjoy our time in the deep without having to\
  \ stress too much about the lack of air, cold temperatures, and pressure damage.\
  \ Spells like <i>endure elements</i>, <i>water breathing</i>, <i>waterproof</i>,\
  \ and <i>ride the waves</i> (combined with a <i>rod of metamagic extend</i>) were\
  \ easy enough to keep track of. At the same time, certain items ensured that we\
  \ had backup measures: <i>pearl of the sirens</i>, <i>necklace of adaptation</i>,\
  \ <i>apparatus of the crab</i>, and pressure pills (from the <a href=\"/products/btpy9toq?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Aquatic-Adventures\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Aquatic Adventures</i></a> sourcebook.</li> \n\
  \       <li>Our list of friends and alliances continued to grow. Nieran Codali,\
  \ a Mordant Spire elf rescued from the bottom of <a href=\"/products/btpy9uk2?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-123-The-Flooded-Cathedral\"\
  ><i>The Flooded Cathedral</i></a>, considered it essential to accompany us after\
  \ he saw that three of our four iconics were human; since, as he explained to Merisiel\
  \ openly, the humans were certain to fail. Though he sometimes refers to us as \"\
  the bastards of Azlant\" and talks about our humans in the third person, we wouldn't\
  \ have survived the final battle without him.</li> \n       <li>While exploring\
  \ the island of Blood Lily Cay in search of an ancient weapon, we spotted a ruined\
  \ temple through the foliage. Facing its divine guardian/broken soul coatl turned\
  \ into a 26-round combat worthy of any World Cup elimination match. Unfortunately,\
  \ our first \"own goal\" of the campaign also occurred, when Kyra cast a <i>mass\
  \ cure light wounds</i> in an attempt to damage the creature she assumed was undead\
  \ (without successfully identifying it). Instead, she healed the coatl at a crucial\
  \ moment, ensuring we'd have to retreat in defeat.</li> \n       <li>Some BIG creatures\
  \ live under the waves, and we're starting to meet them. The best God of War boss\
  \ fights couldn't hold a candle to watching Valeros go into melee alone against\
  \ a gargantuan dire shark, and later a colossal shipwrecker crab. The aquanaut beat\
  \ them both.</li> \n      </ul> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"\

  ></a>\n      </div> \n      <h2>The Odyssey</h2> \n      <p>Talasantri looked unlike\
  \ anywhere we'd ever been, and yet much of the city functioned like plenty of places\
  \ we had been. We shopped, got invited to parties, became caught up in local intrigues,\
  \ and the relationships we built ended up being more important to our success than\
  \ any treasure we found. We had to pick our friends wisely though, and there were\
  \ certainly options: aristocratic merfolk, proud aquatic elves, shady cecaelias,\
  \ and plenty more. Kyra's ability to hit a DC 52 Diplomacy check certainly came\
  \ in useful, but most citizens were indifferent to surface folk, so Dan still had\
  \ to roleplay his way into positions to use it. Ezren even fell for a merfolk who\
  \ styled herself as the \"Arcanic Researcher\" of the city, and was invited to view\
  \ her collection of rare magic items (a visit he wouldn't discuss with us). We're\
  \ keeping the large map we printed of Talasantri, and we'll be going back in this\
  \ campaign—or another.</p> \n      <h2>Character Deaths</h2> \n      <ul> \n   \
  \    <li>Merisiel was able to corner a deep merfolk sorcerer after minutes of chasing\
  \ his multiple castings of <i>dimension door</i>. Facing only the elf, the merfolk\
  \ cast defensively and gambled on a <i>disintegrate</i>. From just a foot away,\
  \ he reached out a finger toward the rogue—natural 20. The critical hit was almost\
  \ inevitable, and Merisiel's saving throw was a tragic natural 1. So 26d6 became\
  \ 52d6, and our GM wanted to roll it all at once. We scoured the house for d6s,\
  \ and everyone pitched in some of their own. Total damage? 192. The single highest\
  \ amount of damage ever delivered by a spell in OAD history.</li> \n       <li>When\
  \ draugr are protecting a shrine of Dagon with <i>keen</i> greataxes, Power Attack,\
  \ and times 3 critical multipliers, some PCs are going to wind up face down. Kyra\
  \ took 57 points of damage in three hits, and Merisiel took 106 points of damage\
  \ in two hits. At least they went out together.</li> \n       <li>An out-of-water\
  \ excursion threw off some adventuring routines we had established, and we stumbled\
  \ into two ambushes by the aptly named Blood Lilies. Koloshkora and Ezren found\
  \ out through experience that the plants were highly poisonous, too.</li> \n   \
  \   </ul> \n      <h3>Best Quote From Marathon 4</h3> \n      <p>(While crossing\
  \ the ocean floor at 20 ft. speed.)</p> \n      <p><b>Valeros:</b> \"Can't this\
  \ thing go any faster?\"</p> \n      <p><b>Merisiel:</b> \"Not with the old man\
  \ driving.\"</p> \n      <p><b>Ezren:</b> \"This is maximum speed, thank you.\"\

  \ our quarry, the veiled master named Ochymua, seeks a weapon with the power to\
  \ devastate Golarion. For assistance, it seems Ochymua contacted an ancient lich\
  \ named Auberon the Drowned—which means now we seek this same lich. Armed with two\
  \ <i>aberration bane</i> weapons and a ranger with a +6 favored enemy bonus, we're\
