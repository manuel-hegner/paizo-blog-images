  \ Special that features kobolds, and a new interactive special. But the important\

  \ \n    <p>When a Chelish blockade closed up the town of Pezzack, the Pathfinder\
  \ Society could do little to stop it. As rumors stir of dissent and rebellion in\
  \ Cheliax, venture-captains have learned that one of the Society's top informants\
  \ still resides in Pezzack. Extracting him should be a simple matter, right? It's\
  \ only a matter of sneaking past one of the strongest armadas, finding one person\
  \ in the ramshackle ruins of a dying town, and then smuggling him out—easy! When\
  \ I created this outline, I knew it needed someone who could juggle a whole lot\
  \ of canon to weave an intricate and exciting story, and freelance editor and frequent\
  \ <a href=\"http://www.pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/\" target=\"_blank\">Pathfinder Wiki</a>\
  \ contributor Garrett Guillotte was a top pick. He's done a stellar job of presenting\
  \ Pezzack in all of its politically twisted, war-weary glory in <a href=\"/products/btpy9cu1\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #6-22: Out of Anarchy</em></a>. In commissioning\
  \ art, it was hard to resist depicting the gnome professor at the Academy of Applied\
  \ Magic who helps the PCs navigate Pezzack's strange politics.</p> \n    <p>Our\
  \ other adventure returns to a country that <a href=\"/pathfindersociety\">Pathfinder\
  \ Society</a> has not visited in a long time—Ustalav—in <a href=\"/products/btpy9cu2\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #6-23: The Darkest Abduction</em></a>. The Society's\
  \ never been popular in Ustalav, and Venture-Captain Basia Kalistoff has done what\
  \ she can to fight the stereotypes of grave robbing, underhanded tactics, and general\
  \ seediness. When noteworthy citizens began disappearing in Karcau, Kalistoff saw\
  \ her chance and offered her lodge's services to Countess Sasandra Livgrace. I knew\
  \ returning author Jerome Virnich would be the right author for the job, especially\
  \ given his work on <a href=\"/products/btpy95zo\"><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting:\
  \ Occult Mysteries</em></a> and his credits in the upcoming <a href=\"/products/btpy9ext\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Hell Unleashed</em></a>. This adventure was also\
  \ an opportunity to depict Venture-Captain Basia Kalistoff, whom we last met in\
  \ Season 1.</p> \n    <p>Back to work for me!</p> \n    <p>John Compton<br> <i>Developer</i></p>\
