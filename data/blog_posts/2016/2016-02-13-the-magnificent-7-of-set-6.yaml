              <h1 itemprop="headline">The Magnificent 7 of Set 6</h1>
              <p class="date">Friday, February 12, 2016</p>
              <div itemprop="articlebody">
               <p itemprop="description">It's Friday, and I've got some delightful news to share with you! I'm pleased to report that last week, WizKids sent Paizo the first batch of digital sculpts for our next, as-yet-unannounced <a href="/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a> set, and they are PHENOMENAL. A few of our editors looked over my shoulder as I flipped through them the first time, and one even suggested that this may turn out to be the best <a href="/pathfinderbattles">Pathfinder Battles</a> set yet. I certainly agree that, at the very least, it's in the same league as some of our very best sets!</p>
               <p>And just wait until you see the case incentive(s)! You guys are going to FREAK!</p>
               <p>Of course, the set has not yet been announced (that happens VERY soon), and the sculpts are still in approvals, so I can't quite show them off just yet.</p>
               <p>But don't despair! I do have some delightful images to show off of actual figure photos of miniatures from <a href="/products/btpy9fyt"><em>Pathfinder Battles Iconic Heroes Set 6</em></a>, which is now available in stores and here on Paizo.com! This set is especially interesting in that it comes with one "extra" figure to help us round out the complete list of iconic characters revealed in Pathfinder RPG hardcovers up to the <a href="/products/btpy978v"><em>Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide</em></a>!</p>
               <p>Check 'em out!</p>
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/Secondary/WZK71783-Quinn.jpg"><img src="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/Secondary/WZK71783-Quinn_180.jpeg"></a>
               </div>
               <p>Here we've got Quinn, Human Investigator, one of my absolute favorites from the entire <a href="/pathfinderbattles/iconicHeroes">Iconic Heroes</a> line (the other one probably being <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lif8">Oloch</a>, from <a href="/products/btpy9f9p"><em>Iconic Heroes Set 5</em></a>. From his perfectly applied eyes and facial details to the huge amount of well-painted gear, this figure has it all. It's also amazingly versatile, and can double easily as numerous characters, from spellcasters to rogues to swashbucklers, from heroes to villains alike. Quinn is COOOOOL, and I'm thrilled to add him not just to the <a href="/pathfinderbattles/iconicHeroes">Iconic Heroes</a> line, but also to my own personal miniatures collection!</p>
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/Secondary/WZK71783-Feyia.jpg"><img src="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/Secondary/WZK71783-Feyia_180.jpeg"></a>
               </div>
               <p>This is the one we've been waiting for ever since the original Feiya, Human Witch turned out something short of everyone's expectations back in the <a href="/products/btpy92s9"><em>Reign of Winter</em></a> set. The recent replacement figure WizKids randomly inserted into <a href="/products/btpy9er4"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a> boosters was a minor improvement, but really revealed that the culprit was a weak face sculpt overall. There just aren't enough details on that face for painters to pick out, resulting in, well, let's just call her a "very happy" Feiya and leave it at that. I'm personally very happy to reveal that the second time is the charm (thanks in no small part to the shift to digital sculpting), and this version of Feiya suffers from none of the problems that marred her first appearance. Her face looks fantastic this time around, and her new "in the middle of battle" pose suits, her, as well. When you're trying to decide which witch to use, I think you'll find this is a witch worth making a switch. Ahem.</p>
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/Secondary/WZK71783-Daji.jpg"><img src="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/Secondary/WZK71783-Daji_180.jpeg"></a>
               </div>
               <p>Of course, a witch isn't much without her familiar, so in this set we've also included Daji, Feiya's fox familiar. Daji has a neat mid-stride pose that differentiates him from the previous <a href="/products/btpy96rb">Fox</a> miniature in <a href="/products/btpy92s9"><em>Reign of Winter</em></a>, and honesty the two foxes go together well for an animal encounter, if you don't want to use it as a familiar. Either way, folks seem to love them some animals, and <a href="/products/btpy9fyt"><em>Iconic Heroes Set 6</em></a> contains one of the most lovable to date.</p>
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/Secondary/WZK71783-Seltyiel.jpg"><img src="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/Secondary/WZK71783-Seltyiel_180.jpeg"></a>
               </div>
               <p>Do you like your men bare-chested and a bit on the "goth" side? This figure is the answer to all of your (probably very adult-oriented) dreams! Seltyiel has his big magus sword ready for a skillful attack, and you just know his thin lips are about to let loose an absolutely cutting insult. I'm currently writing this character in our <a href="/products/btpy9gs3"><em>Pathfinder: Hollow Mountain</em></a> comic from Dynamite, and having a blast. He's pretty much a villain (or, if you prefer, an "anti-hero") in the comic, but on your game table he can be whatever you want him to be. Good guy, bad guy, maybe a little of both...</p>
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/Secondary/WZK71783-Lem.jpg"><img src="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/Secondary/WZK71783-Lem_180.jpeg"></a>
               </div>
               <p>Back in the ancient days, when the then very small Paizo editorial staff was brainstorming iconic characters, we decided that we wanted our iconic halfling bard to have awesome sideburns. "You know," we said, "like Lemmy in Mötorhead." When his illustration came in, I think it was James L. Sutter who suggested "Why don't we just call him Lem?" And a legend was born. I really appreciate the way this version of Lem, Halfling Bard is captured mid-song. Very useful for a bard figure. Alternatively, pair Lem with the Dwarf Bard drummer, the Half-Elf Bard violinist, and some Dancing Girls from <a href="/products/btpy9er4"><em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em></a>, and you've got a ready-made concert!</p>
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/Secondary/WZK71783-Reiko.jpg"><img src="/image/content/Secondary/WZK71783-Reiko_180.jpeg"></a>
               </div>
               <p>We couldn't finish the Iconic Heroes sets without our two Asian-inspired iconics from <a href="/products/btpy8mcz"><em>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat</em></a>, of course! These guys don't get quite the same love as our standard iconics, largely because they represent sub-classes rather than full core classes, but that's pedantic inside baseball talk. They're still super cool, and they deserve some love. Reiko, Human Ninja comes in a sweet battle pose, a chain dangling between her two blades. She's definitely a cool killer you don't want to run into in a dark alley. But if you do, at least you'll now have a miniature to commemorate the encounter!</p>
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/Secondary/WZK71783-Hayato.jpg"><img src="//static4.paizo.com/image/content/Secondary/WZK71783-Hayato_180.jpeg"></a>
               </div>
               <p>Last up this week is Hayato, Human Samurai! With his banner, lamellar armor, helmet, and more, Hayato is perhaps the most detailed of artist Wayne Reynolds's many iconic characters. I'm happy to report that WizKids is up to the challenge, and have delivered a fantastic rendition of the character in <a href="/products/btpy9fyt"><em>Iconic Heroes Set 6</em></a>. Their efforts, as Hayato himself might say, are most honorable.</p>
               <p>All seven figures come with unique cards for use with the <a href="/pathfinder/adventureCardGame">Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</a>, and all are produced at the highest possible quality allowed by the manufacturing process. Now that we've completed all of the Iconic Heroes sets in our original plan, I can say that I am very proud of the work both Paizo and WizKids have put into making these among the finest prepainted plastic gaming figures ever produced. We've done, I think, an excellent job, and have set quality standards it will be difficult for anyone else to match or exceed. But we'll keep trying, of course!</p>
               <p>But wait, I can hear you gasp. Is set 6 really the final Iconic Heroes set?</p>
               <p>That, my friends, remains to be seen. We've had a few discussions with WizKids about what comes next, but nothing has yet been decided officially. I can say that WizKids is watching sales of these sets very closely, so if you'd like to see more of them, the best possible thing you can do is purchase the ones we've already released. We'd all love to produce figures for the <a href="/products/btpy9egu"><em>Occult Adventures</em></a> iconics, or both versions of the vigilante class from <a href="/products/btpy9hj7"><em>Ultimate Intrigue</em></a> (or heck, maybe even a <a href="/products/btpy8j5w">"We Be Goblins"</a> or "Iconic Villains" set), but those decisions are not entirely up to me—they're up to the market.</p>
               <p>I'm at ToyFair in New York City this weekend, where I'll be discussing this and even more diabolical plans in person with our friends at WizKids. I hope to be able to report big things soon!</p>
               <p>But more importantly, we're very very close to the announcement of the next big set, and that means we start the preview train all over again here, every Friday.</p>
               <p>Don't forget to bring lots of coal so we can keep this engine HOT!</p>
               <p>Until then, I remain,</p>
