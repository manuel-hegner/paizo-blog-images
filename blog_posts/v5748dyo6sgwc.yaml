  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Ketchi peered through the\
  \ shrubbery at the overgrown monastery and grinned. \"This must be the place!\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"You <i>think</i>?\" Wik slipped an arrow from his quiver and nocked\
  \ it. \"What was your first clue, our friends languishing in cages, the Firebrand\
  \ graffiti they painted on the wall, or the tribe of hyenafolk slavers who seem\
  \ to have caught them in the act?\"</p> \n     <p>Ketchi twitched his long moustache\
  \ at Wik's sarcasm. \"Since reports of those curs and other slavers setting up operations\
  \ in the area have been so prevalent, and I can't really <i>tell</i> if that's Coriv's\
  \ crew in the cage from here, I’ll go with the big blue crossed swords painted on\
  \ the wall. Even if that’s not our friends, <i>someone’s</i> clearly in need of\
  \ our help.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Keep it down, both of you!\" Layali's dark eyes shone\
  \ like chips of obsidian above her face scarf. She wore the scarf to hide the scars\
  \ she'd received while a slave for speaking disrespectfully to her master. If there\
  \ was anything on Golarion she hated more than slavers, Ketchi didn't know what\
  \ it was. \"I count seven slavers. There may be more inside the ruins. We need to\
  \ free Coriv's crew to even the odds.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Think the one in the crow's\
  \ cage is alive?\" Wik asked.</p> \n     <p>\"We'll find out later.\" Layali flexed\
  \ her hand on the hilt of her sword. \"First, we open the cage.\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  Diversion?\" Ketchi suggested. \"I <i>love</i> diversions. They’re my specialty!\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"Crazy gnome,\" Wik hissed.</p> \n     <p>Ketchi winked at the half-elf.\
  \ \"You bet your pointy ears. Aren't we all?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Valid point,\" Wik\
  \ admitted.</p> \n     <p>\"Quiet!\" Layali pointed to the left. \"Draw them off\
  \ that way, Ketchi. Wik, you cover him. I'll slip through the ruins and open the\
  \ cage.\" She patted the heavy satchel full of weapons. \"Tell Darik and Bosk they're\
  \ our rear guard. When all hell breaks loose, they come in.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Right.\"\
  \ Ketchi slipped back through the underbrush as silent as a ferret to where the\
  \ warriors were hiding. He tapped Darik on his armored shoulder and took some satisfaction\
  \ in the big knight's surprise.</p> \n     <p>\"Bloody gnome! Don't startle me like\
  \ that!\"</p> \n     <p>\"Shhh!\" Ketchi held a finger to his lips and whispered\
  \ the plan. Bosk frowned through his thick Ulfen beard, but Darik nodded. \"Just\
  \ wait for the screaming to start, then come running.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Screaming?\"\
  \ Bosk narrowed his eyes. \"Hyena-men don't scream.\"</p> \n     <p>Ketchi twirled\
  \ his moustache. \"No, but <i>I</i> do.\" He slipped into the brush and worked his\
  \ way around the camp, confident that the slavers wouldn't hear, see, or smell him.\
  \ The crew had done this many times, and knew their jobs. In this instance, they\
  \ were rescuing fellow Firebrands—a team of Bellflower tillers—instead of slaves\
  \ or refugees, but it amounted to the same thing. How Coriv's crew had been captured\
  \ in the first place did concern the gnome, but not overmuch. In his opinion, prisoners\
  \ existed to be freed, regardless of who they were or how they got there.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Finally in place, Ketchi peered over a fallen log to assess the situation.\
  \ The slavers crouched around a firepit, arguing and gnawing on haunches of meat.\
  \ Hopefully that meat wasn't one of Coriv's people. Smoke wafted from one of the\
  \ old monastery's chimneys, so there were probably more. No matter; once they freed\
  \ Coriv's crew, the odds would be in their favor.</p> \n     <p>Ketchi unwound the\
  \ long scarf from his belt, quietly cleared his throat, and meowed.</p> \n     <p>Fourteen\
  \ furry ears swiveled as one toward the noise. Ketchi grinned and meowed again,\
  \ louder. Their bloody muzzles rose from their meal, noses sniffing the air. Another\
  \ meow, and the slavers snarled and spat back and forth in their barking, yipping\
  \ language. Ketchi didn't need an interpreter. <i>Come on you canine cretins, come\
  \ and get the nice kitty</i>. He meowed again, and three of the four slavers rose\
  \ to investigate. The others watched them approach the edge of the camp.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Beyond them, Layali crept along the edge of the monastery toward the cage.\
  \ <i>Perfect!</i> Ketchi cupped his hands around his mouth and summoned his quirky\
  \ arcane talent. \"Meeeeow!\" The sound seemed to come from a clump of bushes some\
  \ fifty feet beyond his hiding place.</p> \n     <p>The slavers snarled and strode\
  \ forth, stepping over the log where Ketchi hid. They had their swords out now,\
  \ and crouched low to inspect the bushes.</p> \n     <p><i>Showtime!</i> Ketchi\
  \ dashed forth and leaped to scramble up the nearest slaver's back, flinging his\
  \ scarf up and around his stunned target's eyes.</p> \n     <p>\"Yeeehaw! <i>Ride</i>\
  \ that dog!\" Ketchi dug his heels into the thrashing slaver's neck and belted out\
  \ a bawdy rhyme. \"Oh, I'm a dog rider, a dog rider is me, tra-la-la, tra-la-la-lee.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>The slaver thrashed and howled. His two companions brandished their\
  \ weapons, but couldn't slash at Ketchi without risking taking off their friend's\
  \ head. The others lurched up from the campfire and charged. Beyond them, Layali\
  \ worked on the cage lock. Wik stood from his hiding place and sent an arrow into\
  \ the rearmost of the charging slavers. Darik and Bosk charged from hiding, weapons\
  \ drawn, but so far, all attention remained fixed upon Ketchi.</p> \n     <p><i>As\
  \ it should be</i>, he thought, belting out another verse, struggling to keep hold\
  \ of his scarf among his blindfolded mount’s thrashing.</p> \n     <p>Then everything\
  \ went sideways.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/082919_BadDogs.jpg\"\

  An armored knight with a sword and shield and a half-elf with a long bow battle\
  \ four ferocious gnolls, while a masked humanoid frees captives from a wooden cage\
  \ in the background.\"></a> \n      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Illustration by\
  \ Tomasz Chistowski</p> \n     </div> \n     <p>A cloaked figure appeared in the\
  \ window of the monastery, her voice crying out an arcane phrase accented by growls\
  \ and clacking teeth. The slaver Ketchi was riding, and all the rest of them for\
  \ that matter, suddenly grew in stature to ogre-height. Ketchi hung on and belted\
  \ out another verse, but drew a dagger with his free hand, just in case. Wik felled\
  \ one of the enlarged slavers with a lightning-fast volley, but another of the beast-men\
  \ threw a spear and caught Bosk in the stomach. The warrior folded over like a sawdust\
  \ doll. Darik bellowed a battle cry and shattered his enemy's shield with a sword\
  \ stroke.</p> \n     <p>Ketchi drove his dagger into the slaver's neck and continued\
  \ his ballad, shifting the theme from one of distraction to encouragement. He sprinkled\
  \ helpful hints to his allies among his lyrics while dodging the slaver's clumsy\
  \ attempts to drag him off.</p> \n     <p>Layali had the cage open, and handed out\
  \ swords to Coriv's crew as they poured out. Several of them dashed into the monastery,\
  \ and more shouts rang out as they clashed with the robed spellcaster and any other\
  \ slavers in the ruin.</p> \n     <p>Ketchi stabbed again, and Wik felled yet another\
  \ slaver with two shots to the chest. Then another slaver lashed out with a long\
  \ whip. The leather wrapped around Ketchi's neck and jerked hard enough to cut his\
  \ song short and unseat him. He held his grip on the scarf, however, unbalancing\
  \ the slaver as he fell.</p> \n     <p>Ketchi landed hard enough to knock the wind\
  \ out of his lungs, but he got a hand around the whip to keep it from throttling\
  \ him. The slaver he'd stabbed had dropped his sword, but lunged at the fallen gnome,\
  \ jaws wide. Ketchi jerked the whip hard and rolled. Slavering jaws snapped closed\
  \ an inch from his shoulder. The whip wielder brought his shield down hard, and\
  \ the edge caught the gnome on the knee.</p> \n     <p>Ketchi howled in pain, \"\
  Ayeee, I'll never dance again!\"</p> \n     <p>The shield came up for another blow,\
  \ but two arrows thunked into the slaver's throat. He looked suddenly surprised\
  \ and fell backward. The other, however, landed on Ketchi like a fallen tree, clawed\
  \ hands grasping and jaws wide.</p> \n     <p>\"<i>Bad</i> dog! No biting the nice\
  \ gnome!\" Ketchi drew another dagger and thrust deep into that maw. The teeth closed\
  \ on his arm and he howled in pain again, but the slaver went limp as it bit down\
  \ on the gnome’s upturned blade.</p> \n     <p>Quiet...</p> \n     <p>The fight\
  \ was over. Coriv's crew waved from the monastery window and reached out to pull\
  \ the crow's cage in. The shape inside moved, alive at least. Darik knelt to Bosk,\
  \ pressing a bottle to the old warrior's lips.</p> \n     <p>Ketchi tried to pry\
  \ the slaver’s jaws open, but they seemed to be locked closed. \"A little help,\
  \ please!\" He tried again, but failed to pry the teeth from his arm. \"I seem to\
  \ have a <i>dog</i> attached to my arm!\"</p> \n     <p>\"Need a hand?\" Wik reached\
  \ down with a knife to carefully slice the seized jaw muscles.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  I nearly <i>lost</i> a hand.\" He winced as the bite relaxed and the teeth came\
  \ free. \"Thanks! Nice shooting, by the way.\" Ketchi unwound the whip from his\
  \ neck and cleared his throat. His knee throbbed, his voice rasped, and his arm\
  \ was bleeding.</p> \n     <p>\"Nice performance.\" Wik drew a potion bottle from\
  \ his satchel and handed it down. \"And nice riding.\"</p> \n     <p>\"I'm thinking\
  \ of taking the act on the road.\" Ketchi downed the sweet elixir and sighed in\
  \ bliss as the pain faded. He lurched up to his feet and tested his knee, then his\
  \ voice. \"La-la-la! What do you think; Ketchi the dog-riding gnome and his canine\
  \ companions?\"</p> \n     <p>\"I think you need to keep the day job.\" Wik chuckled\
  \ and clapped his friend on the shoulder.</p> \n     <p>\"Yeah, probably right.\"\
  \ Ketchi toed the dead slaver and grinned. \"Firebrand's pretty much a full-time\
  \ gig.\"</p> \n     <p style=\"font-weight: bold; line-height: 14px\">About the\
