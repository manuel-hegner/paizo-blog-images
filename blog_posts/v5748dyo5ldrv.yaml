  > \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">With Gen Con just 4 days away, I wanted\
  \ to release the updated <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/about/additionalResources\"\
  >Additional Resources</a> today so everyone has an opportunity to review it and\
  \ discuss it before Gen Con. It also lets people who are picking up their subscription\
  \ items at Gen Con have a list on hand so they can immediately utilize those books\
  \ at the show. Note that even though the Additional Resources is being published\
  \ today, it won’t officially go into effect until August 15.</span></p> \n    <p>With\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy8rcd\"><i>Ultimate Equipment</i></a> being as voluminous\
  \ as it is, I certainly missed a few items that have been banned in the past several\
  \ years. Those items are still banned. If you find an item I forgot to include in\
  \ the <i>Ultimate Equipment</i> list that is banned, please let me know. I will\
  \ make sure they are added in the September update of Additional Resources. </p>\
