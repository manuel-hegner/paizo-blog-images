  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Twice have I been born,\
  \ and with each birthing, I have gained a lifelong companion. The first companion\
  \ was pain, learned the moment I was freed from my mother’s womb to the sight of\
  \ my “father” standing over me with a drawn blade. Lord Bhrostra introduced me to\
  \ my companion daily for years, finding new excuses to beat me and new ways to remind\
  \ me that I was a blight on his house. Pain surrounded me in its warm embrace when\
  \ my true sire, the elf Lairsaph, shattered my knee and left me broken, a gift to\
  \ the men who hunted him so that he could escape while I paid the price for his\
  \ crimes. That pain made me strong, tempered me against hardship, and set my foot\
  \ on the path toward my second companion: the whispers.</p> \n     <p>Trapped in\
  \ a dungeon for half a decade, tortured for the crimes of my sire, the whispers\
  \ comforted me. They etched arcane runes in the hallways of my mind, told me the\
  \ names of beings who could impart strength beyond anything I had dreamed of, and\
  \ carved maps to ancient sites rife with power just waiting to be claimed. They’\
  ve steered me toward ever-greater power since the moment of my emancipation: a scroll\
  \ here, a spellbook there, a magic blade in the hands of an unworthy warrior. Each\
  \ treasure a step closer to my destiny, each foe a whetstone sharpening me for the\
  \ next task.</p> \n     <p>The whispers that brought me here, to this barren wasteland\
  \ of bloodstained stone between the orcish hold of Belkzen and the so-called Gravelands\
  \ ruled by hungry undead. They told me that there once was a mighty black dragon\
  \ named Sharzathinek who served the Whispering Tyrant and that her lair was packed\
  \ with spellbooks and magical trinkets. Such treasures came from a time before the\
  \ Tyrant’s mortal life, ancient magic from an era when today’s archmages would have\
  \ been seen as scarcely more than street magicians. The whispers also told me that\
  \ Sharzathinek was, quite conveniently, dead, slain in a battle far from her lair.\
  \ Hidden in such an inhospitable place as this, perhaps the lair and its treasures\
  \ have gone unnoticed, waiting to be found once more by their rightful inheritor.</p>\
  \ \n     <center>\n      <hr width=\"50%\">\n     </center> \n     <p>The lair should\
  \ be close now. I had to put my horse down several miles back when its hoof caught\
  \ in a rocky crevice and its leg shattered. Perhaps I could have set the bone and\
  \ poured a healing potion down the beast’s throat, but I have used up most of the\
  \ supplies it was intended to carry, and I would prefer to keep my precious healing\
  \ resources for a true emergency. The horse screamed something fierce before I ended\
  \ its misery, and while the dragon whose trove I’m searching for is supposedly long\
  \ dead, some other deadly creature undoubtedly hunts in these lands. Not even the\
  \ orcs wander into this desolation, but something tore apart a band of ghouls just\
  \ a few miles back. Something with claws, teeth, and… acid. </p> \n     <center>\n\
  \      <hr width=\"50%\">\n     </center> \n     <p>The whispers surge in my mind,\
  \ reassuring me that Sharzathinek is long dead. I needed not the reassurance; a\
  \ dragon as old as that one wouldn’t merely have torn the ghouls apart, its claws\
  \ would have scored the stone, and its breath would have melted rock into toxic\
  \ vapor. I suspect that Sharzathinek left behind a clutch of eggs or wyrmling spawn,\
  \ a lesser dragon that has likely claimed its mother’s horde. I don’t fear such\
  \ a lesser creature, though I’m not so foolish as to risk encountering it unprepared.\
  \ </p> \n     <p>I hear the faintest beating of wings far above me in the storm-wracked\
  \ sky, and I use a scroll of protective magic to ward my body and equipment against\
  \ acid. My blade leaps to hand with a thought and with it an array of powerful spells.\
  \ No simple sword, my blade is fused with a powerful staff whose combat spells augment\
  \ my specialized array of magic.</p> \n     <p>With my body warded and weapon in\
  \ hand, I scan the skies. Was that a flicker of a bat-like wing, large enough to\
  \ hold a draft horse aloft? Or had my nerves simply fooled my senses? The whispers\
  \ assure me it was no illusion, so I do the only thing that makes sense. I scream\
  \ into the darkened skies, “Come then, beast! Come and face your better, wyrm! I\
  \ have more important tasks than wasting time with you here in this gods-forsaken\
  \ corner of nowhere!”</p> \n     <p>The taunt works. I hear the faint beating in\
  \ the distance become a deafening hiss, like the linen sail of a great ship tearing\
  \ under the force of a hurricane. Foolish creature, too consumed by its own arrogant\
  \ superiority to mask its approach. As it swoops towards me, for just a moment I\
  \ feel the heavy dread of dragon-fear attempting to cloud my mind, but I brush it\
  \ aside. I unleash a blast of lightning from my blade, wreathing its body in crackling\
  \ arcs of electricity. I hold on to that power, grasping a fraction of its potential\
  \ to wreath my blade in lingering electricity. The beast spews acid as it unleashes\
  \ its deadly breath, but I sidestep the worst of the blast. The few droplets that\
  \ reach me fizzle and fume before being extinguished entirely by my protective wards.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>As the creature’s momentum carries it past me, I step through space\
  \ itself, appearing at its flank and driving my lightning-sheathed sword into its\
  \ flank. It roars as the blade parts its scales and jolts of electric energy sear\
  \ the exposed muscle and nerves beneath, but I’m not done yet. Stepping into the\
  \ blow, I drive the blade further even as I unleash another blast of lightning.\
  \ I can feel the electricity pulling my blade deeper as the monster’s body spasms\
  \ uncontrollably, and I know that I have dealt it a mortal blow. Then its tail slaps\
  \ me across the side of my head, sending my body twisting and tumbling.</p> \n \

  \ woke up a few hours later with a splitting headache, my hair matted to my scalp\
  \ with blood. The dragon’s body lay nearby… Headless? I may be skilled and deadly\
  \ but surely my spell wasn’t that devastating. Crawling, and then walking as I regained\
  \ my equilibrium, I moved next to the dragon. As I inched closer, I noticed that\
  \ its head had broken through a thin layer of dirt and shale into a cavern beneath.\
  \ In the darkness below, I saw the glitter of gold and gems as well as the occasional\
  \ reflective silver of weapons and armor when a line of lightning cut through the\
