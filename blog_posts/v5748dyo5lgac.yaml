  \ by Wayne Reynolds\n    </div> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Past the\
  \ Ironbound Archipelago, across the Steaming Sea, lies the Broken Bay, haven of\
  \ scoundrels, raiders, cutthroats, and killers in the bloodiest viking traditions\
  \ of the Lands of the Linnorm Kings. As a youth, Hakon waited impatiently to come\
  \ of age and join the seasonal southern raids of his countrymen, eagerly absorbing\
  \ the tales of distant lands they brought back with the plunder. The proud raiders\
  \ boasted of desperate battles at sea, of ceaseless storms and sea monsters and\
  \ foreign towns cloaked in sheets of cascading flames. Hakon committed these stories\
  \ to memory, adding his own embellishments to create an oral history for his people—\
  vowing to one day make a place for himself within it.</span></p> \n    <p>Key to\
  \ Hakon's youthful mythology was Hrolf Harfargr, one of the few honorable huscarls\
  \ of Broken Bay's despicable King Ingimundr the Unruly. Hakon's account of Harfargr's\
  \ victory over the ice troll Rimeclaw became something of a phenomenon in the Bay's\
  \ capital settlement of Bildt. Other skalds tried to outdo Hakon's telling, adding\
  \ ever more fantastic feats to the story, increasing Harfargr's reputation and influence.\
  \ Nevertheless, even the embellishments acknowledged the original tale as Hakon's\
  \ as much as that of Hrolf Harfargr, and the young storyteller became a minor celebrity\
  \ in Broken Bay. When he turned 15 later that year, Harfargr claimed him for his\
  \ crew and appointed Hakon as his personal lorekeeper and legend-spinner.</p> \n\
  \    <p>Hakon composed epic poems of Hrolf Harfargr's encounter with the brine dragon\
  \ Kelizar, his crushing victory at sea over Styrbjorn Threefingers, and his romance\
  \ with his greatest rival, the viking hero White Estrid. Hakon stood beside the\
  \ two lovers as Harfargr and his men joined forces with Estrid on her legendary\
  \ run through a Chelish blockade at the Arch of Aroden to find harbor in the distant\
  \ city of Absalom, at the heart of the Inner Sea. On that months-long journey, Hakon\
  \ recorded the tales of heroes like White Estrid, Runewulf the Unbeliever, Molgard\
  \ Swordhand, and the twins Bolgi and Bjarni, slayers of the frost wolf Kuldnir.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>To keep the memories fresh in his mind, Hakon embroidered representations\
  \ of the stories into cloth badges sewn along the hem of his long coat. As he moved\
  \ from badge to badge, Hakon added to the legend of his shipmates, who looked on\
  \ in excitement with each of his tellings. The smiles and encouragement of heroes\
  \ stung Hakon in his heart, however, and what should have been pride was instead\
  \ replaced with regret and shame. For Hrolf Harfargr intended that his personal\
  \ skald would survive to tell his legend, and thus kept Hakon as far from danger\
  \ as possible. Over the years of his time in service to White Estrid, Hakon observed\
  \ the great deeds of heroes triumphing over enemies again and again, but always\
  \ as a witness, and never as the participant he so wanted to be.</p> \n    <p>Upon\
  \ their return to the Lands of the Linnorm Kings from the extended Absalom expedition,\
  \ White Estrid and Hrolf Harfargr had a falling out that separated Hakon from the\
  \ band of heroes that had so inspired his imagination. As Estrid and her crew went\
  \ on to defeat a linnorm dragon and claim the kingdom of Halgrim, Hakon followed\
  \ Hrolf Harfargr back to the Broken Bay. Over the next several years, Hakon watched\
  \ as Harfargr's legend faded. King Ingimundr openly undermined him and tempted the\
  \ fading lord to strike against him. The final humiliation sentenced Harfargr to\
  \ serve upon the crew of a longship captained by a spiteful viking named Girt Bearwearer,\
  \ a hated enemy. Worse, the king ordered Harfargr to sea without his official lorekeeper\
  \ and the recorder of his legendry deeds. Instead, Ingimundr assigned Hakon's younger\
  \ brother, Ostog, to his place at the oars.</p> \n    <p>Hrolf Harfargr, Ostog,\
  \ and Hakon's old companions Bolgi and Bjarni set out on Girt Bearwearer's ship\
  \ among a great armada of raiders with hungry eyes on the rich lands of the distant\
  \ south. They never returned to the Broken Bay, but soon stories made their way\
  \ to Hakon of a mutiny at sea in which Hrolf Harfargr and his allies attempted to\
  \ take the longship from its wicked captain. Their heroism was rewarded with sword\
  \ thrusts and blood eagles. A victorious Bearwearer had his slain enemies thrown\
  \ overboard, food for sea birds and the ravenous beasts of the deep.</p> \n    <p>But\
  \ other stories made their way back to Bildt, too. Tales of a brash young warrior\
  \ named Ostog the Unslain, a survivor of treachery at sea who somehow washed ashore\
  \ in the Varisian town of Sandpoint and who immediately set about creating a legend\
  \ of his own. Hakon had to know if the tales of Ostog's distant deeds were true,\
  \ so he set off on a ship of his own to Sandpoint in an attempt to reunite with\
  \ his brother. He arrived only to find Ostog had already departed, leaving behind\
  \ him the mangled corpses of twisted monsters and wicked men. Hakon began work on\
  \ a new series of badges for his coat in Sandpoint—the Saga of Ostog the Unslain.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Hakon and a band of companions followed Ostog all the way down Avistan's\
  \ western coast, tracing his brother's footsteps in the drying blood of the young\
  \ barbarian's dismembered enemies. His travels took him into the deepest deserts\
  \ of Osirion, back to Absalom, and to a dozen ports in between. Though Hakon has\
  \ not yet caught up with Ostog, the skald's journeys have brought him his own measure\
  \ of renown. In Nisroch he slew the dark druid Roverud. His twin axes—Hagrum's Keel\
  \ and Limbrender—struck down the marsh giant Fogulnur, gaining Hakon the legendary\
  \ Horn of Valenhall, a mystical artifact he only partially understands. Tales of\
  \ these victories fill his companions with unparalleled battle spirit and combat\
  \ prowess, further cementing Hakon's growing legend. Now the badges of Hakon's own\
  \ exploits stand beside those of the true heroes of the Broken Bay, but the skald\
  \ knows that his journeys must continue until his deeds shine like those of Hrolf\
  \ Harfargr, White Estrid, and Ostog the Unslain. Only then will the Saga of Hakon\
  \ be complete, daring those who come after him to even greater feats of bravery\
  \ and legend.</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p> \n   </div> \n  </blockquote>\
