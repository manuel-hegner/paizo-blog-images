  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">“Come on, Couvo!” Seliette\
  \ tugged at his sleeve, breaking his concentration and causing his complex mental\
  \ translation to collapse into gibberish. He blinked up at his fellow student, confused\
  \ by her voluminous waterproof cloak. The last time he’d gone outside onto the grounds\
  \ of the Magaambya, the sky had been blue and cloudless. He hadn’t been sequestered\
  \ in this reading nook <i>that</i> long, had he? Maybe Seliette was off on another\
  \ of her field trips. He could hardly keep track of all the to-ing and fro-ing she\
  \ did with her assorted mentors. “Come on where?”</p> \n     <p>She twirled, cloak\
  \ spinning out around her. “Come and join the dance!”</p> \n     <p>He grunted.\
  \ “Pass.” The tome before him, chronicling a supposed journey through the Doorway\
  \ of the Red Star, hadn’t been written by Old-Mage Jatembe himself, of course—the\
  \ true history of the founder of this school (though it was strange to call a place\
  \ with no real classes or schedules a school!) was shrouded in myth. This book <i>was</i>\
  \ written by a scholar whose grandmother had heard the tale as a child from a descendent\
  \ of one of the Ten Magic Warriors, and that was as close to a primary resource\
  \ as Couvo was likely to get. “This is too important. I can dance once I’ve ascended\
  \ to Conversant.” Couvo had recently finished his term as an Initiate, after spending\
  \ a year sorting a room full of scrolls and tomes recovered on an expedition a decade\
  \ prior and never properly catalogued. Since being promoted to Attendant he’d been\
  \ assisting the arcanist Thanda (some called her Thanda the Wanderer; others Thanda\
  \ the Plunderer) with translating some of her finds from prior expeditions. Couvo\
  \ had come to the Magaambya after a period of study at the College of Mysteries\
  \ in his native Absalom because he’d heard there were works of great antiquity hidden\
  \ away in the Mwangi Expanse. Though he’d found the Magaambya bewildering in many\
  \ respects, it hadn’t disappointed in terms of treasures to translate.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>Seliette plopped down across from him and pulled the book out of his hands.\
  \ He sighed, knowing better to protest. Seliette was a native of Nantambu whose\
  \ parents were associated with the academy, and she’d grown up in the towers, vaults,\
  \ halls, and fields of the Magaambya. She was an Attendant too, and for reasons\
  \ of her own, she’d decided to take Couvo under her wing, a position he found more\
  \ pleasant than annoying as a whole. Without her guidance, he'd still be wondering\
  \ where all the lecture halls and laboratory exercises were instead of successfully\
  \ navigating the looser, stranger approach to the magical arts the faculty took\
  \ here. “Did I say dance?” she said. “Forgive me. I meant to say, 'Come see a high-level\
  \ collaboration between primal and arcane adepts in a rare demonstration of the\
  \ power of halcyon syncretism’.”</p> \n     <p>“Oh.” Couvo closed the book. “Why\
  \ didn’t you <i>say</i> so?”</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/091919_Magaambya.jpg\"\

  >Illustration by Tomasz Chistowski</p> \n     </div> \n     <p>“This looks exactly\
  \ like dancing.” Couvo stood off to the side of a line of drummers who pounded their\
  \ instruments with a beat so compelling it threatened to co-opt the rhythm of his\
  \ own heart. A leaf fell on his head, and long grass tickled his ankles beneath\
  \ his robe. Couvo hated being outside. Hadn't he seen the sky enough for a lifetime\
  \ on his journey to the Mwangi Expanse?</p> \n     <p>“Some of the spellcasting\
  \ I’ve seen you do looks like extremely complicated waving,” Seliette said. “Or\
  \ as if you’re fending off a swarm of bees. This dance is both an ecstatic celebration\
  \ of life, and one component of a spell blending natural and arcane magic.” </p>\
  \ \n     <p>“What are they trying to do?” Couvo looked around the gathering in the\
  \ clearing beneath the trees, trying to figure out who was taking part in the ritual\
  \ and who was a spectator like him. The woman with the elaborate spiral paint was\
  \ surely involved, but what about the catfolk, and—was that a Nidalese man? It was\
  \ amazing who ended up here. There were a few people wearing Magaambyan masks, too—\
  antelope, lion, even lizard—who were probably taking part. As an Attendant Couvo\
  \ had the right to create such a mask, which would allow him to access his spiritual\
  \ self more directly, and would gradually take on a life as its own and serve as\
  \ a sort of familiar... but he found the notion of such a second face disconcerting,\
  \ and since the masks weren’t compulsory, he’d avoided the issue. </p> \n     <p>Seliette\
  \ spread her arms. “They’re going to make it rain.”</p> \n     <p>Couvo glanced\
  \ at her, wondering why she looked so excited. There <i>were</i> clouds gathering,\
  \ and controlling the weather was advanced magic, certainly, but several of Couvo’\
  s teachers back in Absalom could have called thunderstorms or even tornados, if\
  \ the season was right, and they wouldn’t have needed a drum line and a crowd of\
  \ collaborators to manage it. “That’s it? Rain?”</p> \n     <p>She laughed. “Making\
  \ it rain here, I admit, is not so impressive. But the Aspis Consortium has caused\
  \ a terrible drought in one of those barbarous nations you have up there.” She gestured\
  \ vaguely northward. “A group of us plan to travel there and bring the rain back.”\
  </p> \n     <p>“So... this isn’t a ritual to summon a shower for a few hours?” That\
  \ was the extent of the weather control he knew about.</p> \n     <p>“Oh, no. The\
  \ arcane methods of weather manipulation get things started, but the primal magic\
  \ connects more deeply to the land and the air, restoring balance to the area, in\
  \ a sustainable, ongoing way: healing the climate rather than just changing the\
  \ weather.” </p> \n     <p>“So the arcanists provide the spark, and the primal magicians\
  \ create the fuel that keeps the fire going,” Couvo said. He could feel the change\
  \ in the air now, the drop in pressure, the scent of rain. </p> \n     <p>“A fire\
  \ metaphor isn't particularly apt,\" Seliette said, \"but more or less. It's not\
  \ just arcane here and primal there, though. The powers collaborate, and some adepts\
  \ use both forms of magic at once—that's halcyon magic, the blending of traditions\
  \ to create something new and marvelous.” She put her arm around him. “Isn’t that\
  \ why you’re <i>here</i>, Couvo? Or did you just come to read old things? Books\
  \ are wonderful, but to serve the Magaambya is to live in the material world and\
  \ change it for the better. You could come with us and lend your own strength to\
  \ our dance.” </p> \n     <p>He hunched. “I’ve got so much work to do, Seliette—\
  ”</p> \n     <p>“If you want to stay in your reading hole, Thanda will continue\
  \ to take advantage of your talents, I'm sure… but she’ll keep you as an Attendant\
  \ forever. If you hope to become a Conversant, and direct your own studies, you\
  \ have to go <i>out</i>.” She cocked her head. “Tell me, Couvo. What are you doing\
  \ all this studying for? What’s the purpose?” </p> \n     <p>It was a question he’\
  d considered before, and always pushed back to think about later... but maybe later\
  \ was now. There was a certain appeal to staying where it was warm and dry, translating\
  \ the things Thanda brought back from her expeditions, working firmly within the\
  \ limits of his competence, but he knew Seliette was right—that was beginner’s work,\
  \ not substantively different than what he’d done as an Initiate… or even what he’\
  d done back in Absalom. He’d always believed in the value of knowledge for its own\
  \ sake, but could there be new satisfaction in using that knowledge for a purpose?\
  \ He'd just translated a scroll reputedly copied from a Shory manuscript about manipulating\
  \ weather patterns to benefit their legendary flying cities, and perhaps, with the\
  \ proper blend of primal magic, it could be useful here…</p> \n     <p>Rain began\
  \ to fall, just a few drops at first, and Seliette spread out her arms and spun\
  \ in a circle, dancing to the drums and laughing her bell-ring of a laugh. After\
  \ a moment, Couvo reached for her hand and spun with her, as the heavens opened\
  \ and delivered their bounty.</p> \n     <p style=\"font-weight: bold; line-height:\
