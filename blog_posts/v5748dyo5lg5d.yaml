  description\">The <a href=\"/products/btpy8yqx\"><i>Emerald Spire Superdungeon</i></a>\
  \ is the largest Pathfinder Modules product ever produced, a record that's unlikely\
  \ to be taken from it anytime soon. With its release in just a few short weeks,\
  \ we want to make sure it gets the attention and celebration it deserves. At 160\
  \ pages, with 16 levels (by 16 different authors), eight brand-new monsters, enough\
  \ material to take players from 1st to 13th level and several major mysteries, there's\
  \ a LOT of Emerald Spire features to highlight!</span></p> \n    <p>We won't be\
  \ able to cover all the superdungeon's twists and turns (and wouldn't want to spoil\
  \ the fun or players looking forward to discovering the superdungeon's mysteries\
  \ for themselves), but over the next few weeks these blog posts will tease a few\
  \ of the Emerald Spire's secrets, preview some of its amazing art, and giving a\
  \ few of its authors a chance to talk about superdungeons, inspiration, and what\
  \ they cooked up for the biggest Pathfinder Module ever.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>This week we asked some leading questions\
  \ of designers Lisa Stevens (who wrote the 1st level and just happens to be Paizo's\
  \ CEO) and Wolfgang Baur (who wrote the 11th level and is CEO of Open Design and\
  \ a legendary TSR designer). </p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <h2>How do you define\
  \ a \"Superdungeon\"? What is your favorite dungeon or superdungeon experience in\
  \ your personal gaming history?</h2> \n     <p><b><u>Lisa</u></b><br> I define a\
  \ Superdungeon as one whose exploration basically takes up an entire campaign. Or\
  \ at least the vast majority of the campaign. I don't buy into all this parsing\
  \ of superdungeon vs. megadungeon. They are all the same in my book. </p> \n   \
  \  <p>My favorite superdungeon is Temple of Elemental Evil for 1st edition AD&amp;D.\
  \ </p> \n     <p><b><u>Wolfgang</u></b><br> I would say it is any dungeon big enough\
  \ that you never really need anything else; that is, you can start at 1st level\
  \ and run an entire campaign in it. I think that Undermountain is probably my favorite\
  \ for the maps, but there's an argument to be made that the Underdark is a superdungeon.\
  \ You can, after all, run a campaign entirely underground and never bother surface\
  \ dwellers, and I have to say I've loved the Underdark since I first encountered\
  \ it in Gygax's D series with Trampier art. And I haven't stopped loving superdungeons.\
  \ I'm playing in one now, an old-school thing called the Barrowmaze. Good fun, fairly\
  \ deadly, rules-light.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb180\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderModules/PZO9545-Clanky.jpg\"\

  \ your level of the Emerald Spire Superdungeon called? What theme, if any, does\
  \ the level have?</h2> \n     <p><b><u>Lisa</u></b><br> I nabbed the first level,\
  \ which is called The Tower Ruins. I wanted to play around with goblins, so I used\
  \ my super CEO powers to make sure I could. :) </p> \n     <p>The Tower Ruins are\
  \ the part of the dungeon that rests above ground. When I was designing it, I wanted\
  \ to make a level that would be fairly easy to be implemented in <a href=\"/companies/goblinworks\"\
  >Pathfinder Online</a>, which I have also been focusing a lot on lately. My hope\
  \ is that we can at least have my tower ruins inserted into Pathfinder Online sooner\
  \ rather than later because the various enemies are mostly already built for the\
  \ online game. Then, as we have time, we can open up lower levels a level at a time.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>My theme was basically, what would goblins do if they found this cool\
  \ ruined tower level? What insanity would they cook up?</p> \n     <p><b><u>Wolfgang</u></b><br>\
  \ My level is The Tomb of Yarrix, and it has a very clear theme: it is all about\
  \ the entomb of some eldritch horrors from beyond space and time, and the non-standard\
  \ geometry required to make sure that things *stay* entombed. That always seems\
  \ to be the problem, frankly, and tomb-designers have a lot to answer for if adventurers\
  \ ever want to call them out on it.</p> \n     <p>This level does warp space and\
  \ warps time, at least a little, for some oddball encounter effects. The Tomb of\
  \ Yarrix holds some bizarre new creatures and energies, one of which is revealed\
  \ in a slightly roundabout way in the <a href=\"/products/btpy95xv\">Deep Magic</a>\
  \ tome of spells. And the tomb's treasures are similarly antique and obscure. There's\
  \ a mix of weird with strange, and this sort of theme made it easy to work with\
  \ a few of the more out-there monsters from the Bestiaries.</p> \n     <p>All in\
  \ all, it's sanity-blasting fun and a squishy change of pace from your average tomb.</p>\
  \ \n     <h2>What where the inspirations you drew on for your Emerald Spire level,\
  \ and what are you hoping players get out of it?</h2> \n     <p><b><u>Lisa</u></b><br>\
  \ Believe it or not, my inspiration for my level came from the classic D&amp;D module,\
  \ <i>Dragon Mountain</i>. In that adventure, kobolds were put into an environment\
  \ where they have the advantage against the bigger and better equipped PCs, allowing\
  \ the little buggers to really strike fear into a party. I wanted to try to do that\
  \ with goblins. My level has a little twist that gives the resident goblins a pretty\
  \ decided advantage against most adventurers. I wanted players to have to really\
  \ think a bit outside the box, and use brains rather than brawn to overcome those\
  \ pesky goblins. </p> \n     <p>I also put little glimpses into goblin psychology\
  \ into my level. Little bits of treasure to make you scratch your head because they're\
  \ odd, but there's a story behind everything. I'm hoping that GMs are able to bring\
  \ those little stories to light in order to flesh out these goblins as more than\
  \ hp pincushions.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb180\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderModules/PZO9545-Tormankai.jpg\"\

  \ The Tomb of Yarrix borrows its tone from Clark Ashton Smith and his inevitably\
  \ doomed evil high priests, and it's loaded with the ancient and the macabre. There\
  \ are cultists, ancient evils from beyond the mortal realm, and a cult that has\
  \ fallen out of history, but whose adherents still seek to bring just one more extradimensional\
  \ monstrosity out of hiding. There's music that Must Not Be Sung. </p> \n     <p>The\
  \ Tomb happens to fit almost perfectly into the Wasted West of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8txm\"\
  ><i>Midgard Campaign Setting</i></a>, which was one of its other inspirations, largely\
  \ because that region is all about imprisoning ancient Walkers and dimensional tricks.\
  \ It's where a lot of the clockwork and time magic of Deep Magic comes from.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>One of the encounters in Tomb of Yarrix also goes back to C. A. Smith's\
  \ ability to make things horrific without necessarily being deadly. There's a set\
  \ of nests... well, I won't spoil that encounter, but let me just say that if this\
  \ level of Emerald Spire doesn't get at least one \"ewwwww\" out of your players,\
  \ I'll be very surprised. </p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Many thanks to Lisa\
  \ Stevens and Wolfgang Baur for giving us a peak at goblins with a twist, and encounters\
  \ that bend space and time! There's much more Emerald Spire to talk about, but the\
  \ rest will have to wait until next week's post, when at the least we'll take a\
  \ look at the superdungeon's \"fire level,\" and maybe a few more snippets as well.</p>\
