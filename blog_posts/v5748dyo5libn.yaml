  >second issue of Pathfinder Hollow Mountain</a> just debuted, bringing along with\
  \ it an unsettling revelation. As it turns out, Seoni, Valeros, Kyra, Merisiel,\
  \ and Ezren aren't the only adventurers exploring Thassilon's ruins. Demons and\
  \ undead, deadly traps and lethal magic fill the ancient halls of Hollow Mountain,\
  \ but those threats pale in comparison to four of Pathfinder's most unscrupulous\
  \ iconics: Meligaster, Damiel, Oloch, and—of course, my personal favorite—Seltyiel.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>In outlining the Hollow Mountain comic series, Erik Mona, James Sutter,\
  \ and I all had preferences on which issues we wanted to write. Dividing things\
  \ evenly, we knew we each had two parts to play with. Erik had great ideas for the\
  \ densest, most dungeony meat of the story, while Sutter wanted the bookends. As\
  \ for me, I wanted the issues with the bad guys.</p> \n    <p>As you can see from\
  \ the cover, Hollow Mountain #2 reveals that the iconic heroes aren't alone in the\
  \ dungeon. Fresh from their faceoff in <a href=\"/products/btpy9cvj\">Pathfinder\
  \ Origins #3</a>, Seoni and Seltyiel butt heads again, now as leaders as their respective\
  \ adventuring parties. To his side, Seltyiel's recruited several of Pathfinder's\
  \ most morally flexible iconic characters, leading them in a quest for gold and\
  \ glory—but mostly gold.</p> \n    <p>Talking brass stats, though: we've known for\
  \ a long time that Seltyiel's not a nice dude—past character sheets clearly note\
  \ his lawful evil alignment. Clearly greed, charm, and great fashion sense go a\
  \ long way when it comes to being an able member of any adventuring group. Seltyiel's\
  \ the organizing force behind these rival adventurers, but he doesn't have any illusions\
  \ about his team's loyalty: they don't work for him, but rather for a promised payday.\
  \ It's not secret that Seltyiel's my favorite of the iconics, so I'm absolutely\
  \ loving getting another opportunity to give him a voice—especially the smirking,\
  \ sarcastic one I always imagine him having.</p> \n    <p>By the same sinister token,\
  \ Meligaster is chaotic evil. As a manipulator, he's climbing his way to the top\
  \ on the backs and shoulders of enemies and allies alike. And what his ambition\
  \ won't win him, his mesmerist powers will. At his heart, I think Meligaster's a\
  \ coward, but unfortunately for everyone around him he's trained his entire life\
  \ (and his considerable occult powers) to assure that no one ever finds that out.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Damiel's an interesting case, as he's chaotic neutral. He's brilliant,\
  \ but also arrogant, utterly self-serving, and not interested in making friends.\
  \ Damiel brings his mastery of alchemy into Hollow Mountain, curious about what\
  \ ancient insights and strange reagents it might hold. Despite not being evil, though,\
  \ he might be the most calculating and inhuman (in-elven?) of the explorers. This\
  \ makes him a fascinating character to write, as what he's feeling never enters\
  \ into his motivations.</p> \n    <p>Lastly, there's Oloch, another chaotic neutral\
  \ character. With his battle fervor and devotion to Gorum, though, actual Pathfinder\
  \ players might find him the most relatable member of Seltyiel's team. He's along\
  \ for the treasure, sure, but there's also glory and adventure to be had, placing\
  \ him staunchly on the line between brutal foe and potential ally. We've all had\
  \ a lot of fun with Oloch, and the Star Trek fans among us have had to be careful\
  \ not to write him too \"Klingon.\"</p> \n    <p>As the shadows of Seoni and her\
  \ team, Seltyiel and his troupe are every bit as clever and driven. <a href=\"/products/btpy9gry\"\
  >Hollow Mountain #2</a> kicks off the two groups' clash, a rivalry running the rest\
  \ of the series and that promises to leave our heroes wondering what's worse: an\
  \ ancient wizard's deathtrap dungeon or other adventurers.</p> \n    <p>If you're\
  \ like me and always find yourself rooting for the bad guys, you're going to dig\
  \ the newest, nefarious issue of Hollow Mountain. Pick it up right here at paizo.com\
  \ or at your favorite place to buy comics!</p> \n    <p>F. Wesley Schneider<br>\
