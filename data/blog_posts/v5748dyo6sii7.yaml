  \ here! Last time, we peeked at the cover for <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02ej5?Pathfinder-Player-Core-2\"\
  ><em>Player Core 2</em></a> and took a look at look at the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sihv?It-s-All-a-Conspiracy\"\
  >conspirator dragon</a> that had earned a spot on the cover. This time I’ve decided\
  \ to share the draconic wealth and showcase the new fortune dragon. Let’s have a\
  \ look!</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/19dbd374-076f-46e2-bf46-902f6589abbd/ArcaneFortuneDragonDesign_9075x3300.png\"\

  \      <p>Fortune dragons are the other arcane dragon featured in Monster Core.\
  \ Similar to the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6siax?Remaster-Preview-Oh-my-It-s-a-mirage\"\
  >mirage dragon</a>, the fortune dragon embodies direct control over magic. Unlike\
  \ its cousin, the fortune dragon is less about a specific type of magic and more\
  \ about raw magical power.</p>\n      <p>Magical energy and magical potential exist\
  \ everywhere, and much like a person breathing in air, a fortune dragon constantly\
  \ draws in magical energy from their surroundings. They use these energies to empower\
  \ their magical abilities, or even heal their wounds. Though they are arcane dragons,\
  \ their frames are noticeably bulkier than the typical frame of their other arcane\
  \ cousins, and marked by one distinctive feature: their treasure. The constant drawing\
  \ of magical energy creates a strange sort of magnetism that causes coins, gems,\
  \ and magical items to cling to the body of a fortune dragon. This energy even flows\
  \ through the items themselves, causing many of them to heat up and melt in the\
  \ process.</p>\n      <p>Since fortune dragons are constantly drawing on magical\
  \ energy, they have the capability of actively drawing from large surges of energy\
  \ and using it for themselves. While they use spontaneous magic, a fortune dragon\
  \ can recharge their magic by feeding upon other spells that affect them, turning\
  \ a foe’s magic into fuel for their own spell. More powerful fortune dragons even\
  \ have an aura of magical disruption, which makes consuming spells in this way an\
  \ automatic process. Fortune dragons can unleash blasts of pure magical energy,\
  \ manifesting as force damage, to hurt others. These blasts are disruptive as well,\
  \ making others stupefied and leading to more disrupted spells that a fortune dragon\
  \ can consume.</p>\n      <p>Of course, a fortune dragon has an enormous hoard of\
  \ wealth in their lair. These hoards are typically larger than those of other dragons.\
  \ A significant amount of a fortune dragon’s hoard is effectively worthless, however.\
  \ Countless relics litter these hoards, each drained of their innate magic, with\
  \ any inherent value left in the form of non-magical materials. A fortune dragon\
  \ typically keeps their most valued treasures deep within their hoard or even directly\
  \ attached to their bodies.</p>\n      <p>That’s our look at the fortune dragon!\
  \ Make sure to keep an eye out for this dragon and lots of other new dragons when\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02ej4?Pathfinder-Monster-Core\"><em>Monster\
  \ Core</em></a> releases in March. Stay tuned for more draconic previews in the\
  \ coming weeks. Next time, we’ll take a look at the mighty horned dragons. See you\
  \ then!</p>\n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height:\
