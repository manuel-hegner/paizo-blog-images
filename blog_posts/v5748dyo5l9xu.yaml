  \ of Gods and Magic </h1> \n    <p class=\"date\"> Thursday, September 11, 2008\
  \ </p> \n    <p>I've always been a fan of mythology, dating back to my pre-teen\
  \ years reading about the Greek and Norse gods and not coincidentally right around\
  \ the time when I started playing D&amp;D. Working as a designer at Wizards I eventually\
  \ became known as \"the gods guy,\" writing or developing most of the deity write-ups\
  \ for the World of Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms. In the last months of <i>Dragon</i>\
  \ magazine's time at Paizo I wrote a series of Core Beliefs articles for Greyhawk,\
  \ and when James and Wes wanted to keep the series going with the gods of Golarion\
  \ they asked if I'd mind continuing it. Of course, I jumped at the chance—how often\
  \ do you get a chance to shape the mythology of a new published world? Work on those\
  \ articles naturally led to me filling out the gods section of the <i>Pathfinder\
  \ Chronicles Campaign Setting</i>, and that led to writing <i>Gods and Magic</i>.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Tackling this sort of project can be daunting. James, Mike, Wes, and\
  \ Erik all had their ideas about the setting and its history, and all I had were\
  \ a few paragraphs on each deity, which I had to expand into two-page write-ups\
  \ that didn't go against their years of home campaigns and office discussions about\
  \ the world. Fortunately, we had a format that worked—the long deity write-ups in\
  \ <i>Pathfinder</i>—and the first step was to reduce that format from its 6,000–\
  8,000 word incarnation to a more manageable 1,600–word two-page setup. Stripped\
  \ down to a leaner form, I knew exactly what topics I had to cover; the challenge\
  \ was getting into the right mindset for writing about each of the 20 deities, which\
  \ is where real-world inspiration comes in.</p> \n    <p>Thousands of years of human\
  \ history have created hundreds of strange beliefs suitable for adapting into a\
  \ game. Sacred prostitutes? Check. Mortals making pacts with fiends? Check. Beast-headed\
  \ protector deities? Check. And so on. Using the references on my bookshelf, bits\
  \ from the History Channel, and online sources such as Wikipedia, I was able to\
  \ find idea seeds that I could \"game up\" for an interesting deity description.\
  \ The ultimate goal was twofold: one, to make the gods cool enough that GMs think,\
  \ \"I need to get these guys into my game as soon as possible,\" and two, to make\
  \ them cool enough that players think, \"I want to play a priest of this god as\
  \ soon as possible.' Depending on the deity, this may require making them sexy (like\
  \ Calistria), creepy (like Zon-Kuthon), badass (like Iomedae), or some other \"\
  hook.\"</p> \n    <p>Most of the text in the deity write-ups is \"fluff\" rather\
  \ than \"crunch\"—descriptive material with no game mechanics, useful for getting\
  \ the feel of a religion but usually not enough to differentiate them when the dice\
  \ hit the table. Fortunately, this book has a lot of room for crunch; each deity\
  \ gets a faith-specific spell and magic item, and these help nail down aspects of\
  \ the god and his or her worshipers as well. For example, there's an Asmodean magic\
  \ item that lets a worshiper use his own blood to augment certain spells. Calistria's\
  \ priests can seduce an enemy, then cast a spell to avenge themselves against that\
  \ enemy. Rovagug's cult has an item that causes rage if the wearer is bound or shackled.\
  \ Torag's priests have a spell that turns failures into successes. Urgathoa's followers\
  \ can compel enemies to eat their own fallen comrades. Little things like this help\
  \ establish the reality in a fantasy world where these gods and goddesses are real.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><i>Gods and Magic</i> was a fun book to write. The work situation was\
  \ a bit more hectic than my normal experience (near my deadline I had my sister's\
  \ wedding and moved to Washington to start full-time at Paizo) but I'm familiar\
  \ enough with the process of writing this sort of material that I could let my instincts\
  \ steer me true. It doesn't hurt that the rest of the Paizo team is very supportive\
  \ and gives great feedback—a smart designer quickly learns to rely on these open\
  \ channels of communication to make their work stronger, and that is precisely what\
  \ I did. I think this book will become an integral part of your Golarion collection,\
  \ and I hope you enjoy it. </p> \n    <p>P.S. Please send pie.</p> \n    <p> Sean\
