  \  <p itemprop=\"description\">I've known Jekka and Mirian Raas for far longer than\
  \ might be apparent. Their first adventure was published in the 2015 release <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy9e42?Pathfinder-Tales-Beyond-the-Pool-of-Stars\"><em>Beyond\
  \ the Pool of Stars</em></a>, but two VERY similar characters with the same names\
  \ appeared in one of my earliest published short stories more than a decade ago.\
  \ Jekka was almost exactly the same; it was Mirian who lacked a little something\
  \ to make her more unique. James Sutter suggested her dual heritage, and once that\
  \ was added to her character, and I changed the setting to Golarion's Sargava, the\
  \ rest snapped quickly into place.</p> \n    <p>Long before I started drafting <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy8iqp?Pathfinder-Tales-Plague-of-Shadows\"><em>Plague of Shadows</em></a>,\
  \ back when James and I were tossing ideas around about who would star in my first\
  \ Pathfinder book, I showed him the rough draft of a novel I was working on about\
  \ Mirian and Jekka. He liked it enough that it stuck in his memory, but back then\
  \ the line was just getting started, and he understandably wanted something a little\
  \ less experimental than a book featuring a magical salvage diver and her lizardfolk\
  \ friend. But after two novels starring Elyana and Drelm I was wanting to try something\
  \ a little different, and James still liked the pitch starring Mirian and Jekka,\
  \ so he greenlit a project featuring them.</p> \n    <p>That meant that the pitch\
  \ was approved; I still needed to get the details down and make sure any events\
  \ in the book wouldn't tread on concepts being developed by other authors for other\
  \ novels. That's why James wisely likes to examine detailed outlines. I'm used to\
  \ drafting outlines, but not the way I did these. First, I was originally planning\
  \ just one book, but I was having so much fun that I went ahead and kept outlining\
  \ another tale right on the heels of the first. Second, a substantial chunk of the\
  \ outline was written while I was sitting in The Three Broomsticks while my wife\
  \ and daughter rode and re-rode a bunch of Harry Potter roller coasters. My own\
  \ enjoyment of roller coasters has waned, you see. While drafting with my notebook\
  \ I was struck that I was writing the outline for an imaginary adventure in an imaginary\
  \ location. Or at least, a location that had once been imaginary.</p> \n    <p>Later\
  \ during that same Florida vacation I pulled out the pocket notebook again while\
  \ my daughter was riding The Tower of Terror over at Hollywood Studios and made\
  \ some more additions.</p> \n    <p>I'm not sure what James first thought when he\
  \ got two outlines instead of the expected one, but he liked them both, and signed\
  \ me on for two new books. I actually wrote them back to back, one right after the\
  \ other, as they're set only a few weeks apart, but Paizo didn't want to release\
  \ them one after the otherâ€”how many underwater salvage books with lizardfolk co-stars\
  \ do you need released in a single year, right?</p> \n    <p>But here the second\
  \ one is at last. I think I enjoyed drafting it even more than the first. This time\
  \ I wrote Jekka as one of the point of view characters, and man, did I have fun\
  \ with that. And I added a new character by the name of Captain Ensara, and his\
  \ point of view chapters were just as much fun to draft. Hopefully you'll see why\
  \ when you meet this shady pirate captain, who's not as evil as he thinks he is\
  \ but isn't as good as you'd like him to be.</p> \n    <p>I've been a roleplaying\
  \ gamer since the mid '70s. I've had occasional hiatuses, but I don't think any\
  \ of them have lasted more than a year. Maybe it's the storyteller in me, but I\
  \ always come back to it. And I usually end up as the Game Master. I'd like to think\
  \ all those years of practice have helped hone my storytelling. I've drawn upon\
  \ some plots and villains to write my Dabir and Asim stories (the villain's plan\
  \ in The Desert of Souls is straight out of one of my fantasy campaigns). But until\
  \ these books I've never actually used any characters from my games in my fiction.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Captain Ensara is one of those, a recurring non-player character my players\
  \ enjoyed who was slightly sinister yet retained a ragged code of honor. And Jekka's\
  \ cousin, Kalina, is my wife's character, down to her name and even her weapons.\
  \ If you like those weapons Kalina carts around, and their names, that's all my\
  \ wife Shannon's doing. I based Kalina's personality upon the way my wife plays\
  \ her.</p> \n    <p>Honestly, Kalina is so much fun to see in action that when one\
  \ campaign with her wrapped up I encouraged my wife to carry her over into the next.\
  \ Certainly Kalina's one of her all time best characters. I don't know if you've\
  \ seen this in your own games, but sometimes there's a character that just \"sparks\"\
  \ reaction in other characters and helps create situations that deepen the world\
  \ and provide hooks for other players to hang things on. (I'm not talking about\
  \ the sort of character who needlessly creates drama or pulls the adventure off\
  \ track.) I'm actually very fortunate to have a group that's so experienced that\
  \ they all manage that spark at different times, but so far the rest of those characters\
  \ haven't made the transfer to my fiction. Who knows, maybe one day the world will\
  \ be ready for Ash and Kol and Quirok and Tylin...</p> \n    <p>For now, though,\
  \ you've got a chance to get to know Jekka even better than you did in the first\
  \ book. All your favorite survivors from the first book are there as well, including\
  \ the heroic Ivrian and, of course, the daring Mirian Raas. It's my hope that you'll\
  \ enjoy reading this new adventure as much as I enjoyed writing it.</p> \n    <p>Howard\
