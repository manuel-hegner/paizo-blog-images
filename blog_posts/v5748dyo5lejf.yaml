  \ Tim Pratt</p> \n   <h2>Chapter One: Ill Met by Torchlight</h2> \n   <div itemprop=\"\
  articleBody\"> \n    <p><span itemprop=\"description\">Rodrick—pragmatist, opportunist,\
  \ and occasional outright thief—groaned and tried to sit up, but only managed to\
  \ half-lean against the wall of a lightless cavern. His head had felt like this\
  \ many times before, but usually only after a night of drinking and wenching. His\
  \ memories of the prior hours were fuzzy, but they didn't involve taverns and winsome\
  \ (or buxom, or both; he wasn't picky) maids.</span></p> \n    <p>Images bobbed\
  \ in his mind like rotting apples in a pond. A body, crushed in a trap. A man with\
  \ a weaselly narrow face and a pack full of potions. A creature that looked like\
  \ a beautiful woman from one side, and a gnarled, hollowed-out tree from the other.\
  \ A room full of shattered treasure chests, and a suit of ancient black armor, and\
  \ a distressingly large hole in the back wall—</p> \n    <p>Then he remembered.\
  \ Sneaking into a barrow rumored to be full of treasure, accompanied by a fool named\
  \ Simeon who'd gotten himself killed in a trap before they were even well begun.\
  \ Disabling traps and killing a monster, assisted by a treacherous alchemist named\
  \ Alaeron. They'd had a small disagreement about how to proceed, and so the alchemist\
  \ had drugged Rodrick, knocking him unconscious and leaving him here to die. </p>\
  \ \n    <p>Or, more accurately, to wake up with a headache.</p> \n    <p>Rodrick\
  \ patted his pockets and discovered that all of his knives were gone, even the ones\
  \ in his boots. No surprise, really, since his boots were also gone. The alchemist\
  \ had stolen his shoes. That was nicer than stabbing Rodrick in the neck, admittedly,\
  \ but still quite rude.</p> \n    <p>Now he sat slumped on a sloping hill, in a\
  \ dark cavern that stank of something rank and reptilian, which Alaeron had claimed\
  \ was a linnorm—a great slumbering beast that wasn't exactly the same as a dragon,\
  \ but close enough. This barrow of treasures plundered from the North had included\
  \ a linnorm egg, which had, at some point, hatched and grown to full size. The beast\
  \ had smashed through the tomb wall into a system of caves and constructed a lair\
  \ there, complete with a hoard made from the gold and gems and magical geegaws Rodrick\
  \ had come to steal.</p> \n    <p>The linnorm had been the source of Rodrick's disagreement\
  \ with the alchemist. Rodrick had advocated sneaking into the linnorm's cave and\
  \ stealing everything, while Alaeron had favored running away and living to loot\
  \ another day. Rodrick had insisted on his course of action, using a sword to advance\
  \ his argument, and Alaeron had replied with a potion.</p> \n    <p>Rodrick began\
  \ to crawl up the slope, quietly, toward the hole in the wall. There should have\
  \ been torches lit in there. Either they'd burned out, or Alaeron had doused them\
  \ when he left. </p> \n    <p>Having groped his way back into the mostly-empty treasure\
  \ room, Rodrick crawled without success along the floor, looking for the lantern.\
  \ No luck—the alchemist had taken it—but he did find an unlit torch, and he still\
  \ had his flint and steel, at least. He got the torch lit and breathed a shaky sigh\
  \ of relief as light blossomed in the dark.</p> \n    <p> After lighting the other\
  \ torches on the walls, he sat in a carved wooden throne and considered his options.\
  \ He was tempted to pursue Alaeron and exact revenge, but there was a more pressing\
  \ concern: acquisition.</p> \n    <p>The most important thing was the sword. The\
  \ alchemist had used a potion of darkvision to look over the sleeping linnorm and\
  \ its hoard, and had claimed to see a sword, so that was promising. Rodrick had\
  \ spun a tale for the alchemist about discovering the existence of this barrow and\
  \ deciding to pillage it with his friend Simeon, but that was only partly true.\
  \ Rodrick had actually been hired by a wealthy collector to break into this place\
  \ and retrieve the sword, rumored to be an artifact of great power. Anything else\
  \ he could steal was his to keep, in addition to a hefty payment in coinage. </p>\
  \ \n    <p>Returning to Manius without the sword wasn't really an option if Rodrick\
  \ wanted to keep his head. He could flee, with the collector's up-front payment\
  \ in his pockets—but no, damn it, Alaeron had stolen his coin purse too—and probably\
  \ escape any unpleasant consequences by changing his name again and heading south.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>Escape was tempting. He was no dragon-slayer, even if linnorms weren't\
  \ exactly dragons. But the treasure... the treasure was even more tempting. </p>\
  \ \n    <p>He sighed, rose, lifted a torch from its sconce, and slowly approached\
  \ the hole in the wall. He stepped through carefully, the torch held out in front\
  \ of him.</p> \n    <p>The light immediately returned to him, shining from a shimmering\
  \ lake of golden coins and glimmering jewels. As always, the sight of large quantities\
  \ of wealth took his breath away. Alas, he could also see the pale scaled belly\
  \ of something immense coiled atop the hoard. He'd hesitated to bring light into\
  \ this chamber before, for fear of waking the beast, but then he'd had an alchemist\
  \ on hand, with potions that would let them see in the dark. Circumstances had changed,\
  \ and necessity demanded a certain amount of risk.</p> \n    <p>He crept down the\
  \ slope, to the more-or-less level bottom of the chamber, just a few feet from the\
  \ outlying spill of gold and gems. In this case, being barefoot was actually a boon—\
  his footing was more sure, and he could move through the coins far less noisily.\
  \ Rodrick mostly watched his feet, carefully sliding coins aside to find secure\
  \ footing underneath, but occasionally he glanced up and saw more and more of the\
  \ linnorm revealed. The thing was large enough that he couldn't apprehend it as\
  \ a whole—it seemed serpentine, wrapped around and around itself. At least its head\
  \ wasn't visible. Alaeron had said the creatures could hibernate for centuries,\
  \ so Rodrick hoped a little torchlight wouldn't serve to wake it up. </p> \n   \
  \ <p>His circle of light continued to advance. At last, it touched the hilt and\
  \ first foot or so of a longsword's blade. Unfortunately, the remainder of the sword\
  \ was firmly wedged beneath the linnorm itself, both resting atop a bed of coins.\
  \ Perhaps if Rodrick undermined the coins—</p> \n    <p>\"Do you mind?\" The voice\
  \ was deep, faintly annoyed, and slightly muffled, as if the speaker were wrapped\
  \ in a blanket.</p> \n    <p>Rodrick froze. \"I... beg your pardon?\" he whispered.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The voice didn't bother to whisper. \"As well you should. Do I come creeping\
  \ into your bedchamber at night and shine a light in your face? Well?\"</p> \n \

  0\"></a>\n     <br> Rodrick is cunning, but that doesn't make him wise.\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <p>\"Uh, who is this speaking?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Me,\" the voice replied\
  \ unhelpfully. \"What are you doing in here? In case you haven't noticed, there's\
  \ a linnorm sleeping a few feet from your face. You wouldn't enjoy waking it up.\
  \ If it even rolls over in its sleep you'll be crushed by its coils. The thing must\
  \ be sixty feet long.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I'd love to discuss my motivations, but I'd\
  \ like to know who I'm talking to—\"</p> \n    <p>\"I'm the sword, idiot,\" the\
  \ sword said. \"Call me Hrym, if you must call me something.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Ah.\"\
  \ Rodrick closed his eyes, but only briefly. \"The sword. Of course. I'd heard rumors\
  \ that you could speak, but I didn't entirely believe them.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I'm\
  \ a rare breed,\" Hrym said. His voice was muffled—presumably because he was jammed\
  \ beneath several tons of sleeping monster. \"Who're you?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Rodrick.\
  \ An adventurer.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Stay here too long and you're sure to have an\
  \ adventure, though it's likely to be your last. Why don't you have any shoes on?\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"I had a disagreement with a, ah, fellow adventurer, and he stole\
  \ them.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Mmm. There's a pair of boots there, about a foot to your\
  \ right.\"</p> \n    <p>Rodrick turned his head slightly and moved the torch. A\
  \ pair of pale blue boots were indeed jumbled in with the gold and gems. \"Are they\
  \ magical?\"</p> \n    <p>\"No,\" Hrym said, the sarcasm unmistakable. \"They're\
  \ perfectly ordinary boots, sealed up in a warlord's barrow with all his other treasures.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Ah. Do you know how they're magical?\"</p> \n    <p>\"They let you\
  \ walk on water, if I recall,\" Hrym said.</p> \n    <p>Rodrick sighed. \"Hardly\
  \ helpful in my current circumstances.\"</p> \n    <p>\"They are also quite functional\
  \ as ordinary boots.\"</p> \n    <p>\"A fair point.\" Rodrick slid over the gold,\
  \ wincing as a small cascade of coins tinkled and chimed together. He stuck the\
  \ torch down in the heap of gold—a bit like shoving a stick into sand—to free his\
  \ hands, tied the laces of the boots together, and hung them around his neck like\
  \ an unwieldy scarf.</p> \n    <p>\"Most people wear those on their feet,\" Hrym\
  \ said. \"But I'm sure your bold new fashion will soon be all the rage. Away with\
  \ you, adventurer! I doubt the linnorm will notice the absence of the boots—they\
  \ were just sort of swept along with the rest of the treasure. As long as you don't\
  \ try to remove anything shiny from the hoard, you can probably escape.\"</p> \n\
  \    <p>Rodrick thought of the gems and rings he'd already dropped into his pockets\
  \ along the way and decided to pretend he hadn't heard that last part. \"The boots\
  \ are nice, but I'd rather hoped to leave with a bit more.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Don't\
  \ be greedy,\" Hrym said. \"It's unseemly in a human. Why, think of the money you\
  \ could make ferrying people across rivers. You've got nice broad shoulders and\
  \ strong arms—you could probably carry two, maybe three people at a time. If they\
  \ didn't have any luggage.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Sword—Hrym—I'm here to rescue you.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"Rescue,\" the sword said. \"Rescue? Would you ask me to rescue you\
  \ from a brothel or a barroom?\"</p> \n    <p>Rodrick frowned. \"I suppose it depends\
  \ on the circumstances—\"</p> \n    <p>\"I love it here, human. Do you know my fondest\
  \ aspiration in this world? It's to sleep on a bed of gold. And do you know what\
  \ I'm doing just this very moment? Sleeping on a bed of gold! Or I was sleeping,\
  \ until you shone a light in my face.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You don't have a face.\"\
  </p> \n    <p>\"And you don't have a very good grasp of metaphor. Fine, then, you\
  \ shone a light on my hilt—\"</p> \n    <p>\"Which I assume would be less akin to\
  \ your face and more akin to your—\"</p> \n    <p>\"My point,\" the sword said,\
  \ loudly, \"is that I don't need to be rescued. What you really mean is 'stolen.'\
  \ Now go away before I wake the linnorm.\"</p> \n    <p>Rodrick considered. Stealing\
  \ a sword should have been a lot simpler than this. But the sword had a mind—of\
  \ sorts—which meant that it could be manipulated. And Rodrick was far better at\
  \ manipulation than he was a burglary. </p> \n    <p>\"Suit yourself,\" he said.\
  \ \"My client will be disappointed.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Oh, to know I caused the disappointment\
  \ of some human I've never met or heard of, how will I stand the pain? Now, go.\
  \ This beast is hibernating, but I have ways of stirring it into consciousness very\
  \ quickly.\"</p> \n    <p>\"All right, fine. You're missing out, though. I mean,\
  \ you call this a pile of gold? Pfft.\" </p> \n    <p>\"Pfft?\" Hrym said. \"These\
  \ are the all the riches acquired by the warrior Brant, slayer of beasts and men,\
  \ despoiler of vaults—\"</p> \n    <p>\"Oh, I mean, it's alright,\" Rodrick said.\
  \ \"I wouldn't mind having this lot in my house, certainly. But my employer doesn't\
  \ pillage. He invests. He owns half of Andoran, including the banks, and he believes\
  \ in keeping a ready supply of coin on hand. There's a basement in his house that's\
  \ so full of gold and gems that he has ten clerks working full-time just to inventory\
  \ it all, and they can't keep up with the fresh cartloads of coins that arrive every\
  \ day. He loves money, but more than that, he's a collector of rare and precious\
  \ magical items and relics. You, of course, are one of the most rare and precious\
  \ in the world—\"</p> \n    <p>\"This is true,\" Hrym said.</p> \n    <p>\"—and\
  \ he desires greatly to add you to his collection. Why, he's paying me more gold\
  \ than I see here just to deliver you to him! Hrym, you could rest in a place of\
  \ pride atop a mound of treasure that makes this look like the dregs of a drunkard's\
  \ coinpurse after a holiday. Or you can stay wedged under the ass of a monster,\
  \ if you prefer.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Hmmm,\" Hrym said. \"If this is a trick, you'll\
  \ regret it. I have powers beyond mere speech.\"</p> \n    <p>\"I'm sure you do,\"\
  \ Rodrick said. \"Shall we?\"</p> \n    <p>\"Very well. Draw me forth. But slowly,\
  \ so I don't slice the beast.\"</p> \n    <p>Rodrick moved toward the sword, grasped\
  \ the hilt, and gently drew out the blade. The linnorm didn't so much as shift—\
  it might have been carved of stone.</p> \n    <p>Hrym's blade was dazzling. It was\
  \ made not of steel, but rather of some bluish-white crystal, gleaming like a faceted\
  \ diamond in the torchlight. The substance resembled nothing so much as—</p> \n\
  \    <p>\"Ice,\" Rodrick whispered. \"I'd heard you were a blade of living ice,\
  \ but I didn't know what that meant.\"</p> \n    <p>\"You still don't,\" Hrym said.\
  \ \"Now go, quickly.\"</p> \n    <p>Rodrick held Hrym aloft and carefully worked\
  \ his way down the slope, moving in a low crouch, away from the light of the torch.\
  \ He paused halfway down, spying what looked like a silver bell as big as a man's\
  \ head, half-buried in coins. \"Is that—is that the bell that summons blizzards?\"\
  \ he whispered. \"I heard there was such a thing here.\"</p> \n    <p>\"Oh, probably,\"\
  \ Hrym said.</p> \n    <p>\"I can carry that too,\" Rodrick said, and moved carefully\
  \ sideways.</p> \n    <p>\"I wouldn't do that.\" Hrym said.</p> \n    <p>\"In that\
  \ respect, we differ.\" Rodrick reached for the bell, brushing away coins with his\
  \ free hand, and grasped the ring at the top. He lifted the bell up, carefully,\
  \ slowly—</p> \n    <p>And as it came free from the heap of gold, the clapper struck\
  \ a deep, low note so loud it brought back Rodrick's headache in full force. An\
  \ icy wind suddenly blew through the cavern, and the great coils of the linnorm\
  \ began to move. </p>\n    <p><b>Coming Next Week:</b> The perils of waking a linnorm\
