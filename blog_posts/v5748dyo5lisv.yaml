  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">Once upon a time, October's <a href=\"/products/btpy9kcu\"\
  ><em>Deadly Foes</em></a> set of prepainted plastic miniatures from the <a href=\"\
  /pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a> line had a much heavier focus on fiends\
  \ vs. celestials, with a huge emphasis on the devils of Hell. Probably too much\
  \ of an emphasis, if I'm being completely honest. Eventually we toned down some\
  \ of the diabolical content and replaced it with other creatures to give the set\
  \ a more general appeal, but some of that infernal impetus still remains, and there\
  \ are PLENTY of devils left in <a href=\"/products/btpy9kcu\"><em>Deadly Foes</em></a>.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>This week, I'd like to show off a couple of the minor devils in the setâ€”\
  the Lemure and the Accuser.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\

  //static2.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160513-Lemure_360.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Here we have the Lemure, and from where I sit I'm not certain\
  \ that we've ever produced a figure quite so ugly. And I mean that in the nicest\
  \ possible way! The <a href=\"/products/btpy8auu\"><em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</em></a>\
  \ describes Lemure Devils as the least of devilkind, shapeless masses of quivering\
  \ flesh. They are further described as \"grotesque and useless.\" I beg to differ\
  \ on that last point! I can see swarms of these guys converging upon my player characters.\
  \ The Lemure is a CR 1 Medium figure at the common rarity.</p> \n    <div class=\"\
  blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160513-AccuserDevil.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20160513-AccuserDevil_180.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>Our second fiend today comes from the pages of <a href=\"/products/btpy8hif\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2</em></a>, which describes them as \"childlike souls\
  \ tormented and scoured of innocence by the flames of Hell and then reshaped by\
  \ the mad whims of the archdevil Baalzebul.\" Accuser devils embody the foul, merciless,\
  \ and pervasive corruptions of Hell. At CR 3, they also make for great group encounters.\
  \ This gross little guy is slated at the common rarity, making him perfect for an\
  \ otherworldly ambush by the party's devilish foes. The Accuser Devil is a Small\
  \ figure.</p> \n    <p>There are a lot more devils coming in <a href=\"/products/btpy9kcu\"\
  ><em>Deadly Foes</em></a>, but I've made my own infernal promise to drag these previews\
  \ out until October, so I'm afraid they'll have to wait for future previews!</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Until then, I remain...</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
