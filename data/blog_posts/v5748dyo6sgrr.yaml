  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Shortly after the first\
  \ whispers of a new edition of Pathfinder first started circulating, we knew that\
  \ organized play would play a major role in playtesting. While our team's quite\
  \ experienced at designing adventures, we swiftly realized there was one thing we\
  \ stood no chance at creating in 2018: fair rewards for a game whose final form\
  \ could change dramatically and unpredictably based on playtest results (to say\
  \ nothing of our wanting tons of Chronicle sheet feedback, so we couldn't even create\
  \ long-term character records). </p> \n      <p>Yet we also wanted to reward players\
  \ and GMs alike—ideally in a way that was fun, yet didn't grant an insurmountable\
  \ benefit to playtesters over those who joined the campaign later. From this came\
  \ Playtest Points (PTP), a currency to spend on fun benefits in 2019 once the Second\
  \ Edition rules were finalized—rules with which the organized play team could create\
  \ new boons once the new campaign was ready to launch. As we get ever closer to\
  \ releasing the new Pathfinder Society Guide to Play, scenarios, and more, it's\
  \ now time to give a preview of what's coming for Playtest Points.</p> \n      <p>There\
  \ are 14 rewards to look forward to, many of them inspired by the playtest adventures.\
  \ We're expecting the store to go live the week before Gen Con, at which point you'll\
  \ be able to redeem PTP for boons. One of these rewards you can only buy once, whereas\
  \ the rest you can purchase multiple times if you're so inspired. Just be aware\
  \ that 11 of these have scaling costs, with the first copy of the boon being fairly\
  \ inexpensive and duplicates being available at a higher price. </p> \n      <p>Let's\
  \ take a look at some of these rewards!</p> \n      <blockquote> \n       <p>❑ <strong>Experienced\
  \ Adventurer (Limited-Use, Slotless):</strong> Whether you joined the Pathfinder\
  \ Society after several independent adventures or you quickly surpassed your peers\
  \ during training to become a Pathfinder agent, you're a capable explorer by the\
  \ time you set out on your first official assignment. You can check the box that\
  \ precedes this boon when creating a new character to begin that character at 2nd\
  \ level with 12 XP, 12 Fame, 12 Reputation distributed between one or more factions,\
  \ and 30 gp. Include this boon with the new character.</p> \n       <p><strong>Initiate's\
  \ Wayfinder (Slotless Boon):</strong> As part of your confirmation as a Pathfinder\
  \ field agent, you received a <em>wayfinder</em> (<em>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</em>\
  \ 617) to carry as both a badge of office and as a useful tool. This wayfinder has\
  \ an effective price of 0 gp for the purpose of resale.</p> \n       <p><strong>Emergency\
  \ Draught (Item, Limited-Use):</strong> You almost always have a healing potion\
  \ hidden away for an emergency. You gain the following action.<br> <span style=\"\
  padding-left: 10px;\"><strong>[two-actions]</strong> (manipulate) <strong>Frequency</strong>\
  \ Once per adventure; <strong>Uses 3</strong> ❑ ❑ ❑; <strong>Effect</strong> You\
  \ search your gear and draw a <em>minor healing potion</em> in one hand. If you\
  \ are at least 3rd level, you can instead draw a <em>lesser healing potion</em>.\
  \ If you are at least 6th level, you can instead draw a moderate healing potion.\
  \ If you are at least 12th level, you can instead draw a <em>greater healing potion</em>.\
  \ If you are at least 18th level, you can instead draw a major healing potion. This\
  \ potion lasts until the end of the adventure, after which it loses its potency.\
  \ The potion's effective price if sold is 0 gp.</span></p> \n       <p><strong>Red\
  \ Flag Espionage (Social): </strong>You have experience with delicate social situations\
  \ where a false move could antagonize a possible ally or accidentally endanger a\
  \ comrade. When using Diplomacy to Make an Impression or Request, you critically\
  \ fail the check if you fail the check DC by 12 or more (rather than failing by\
  \ 10 or more). In addition, you gain the following reaction.<br> <span style=\"\
  padding-left: 10px;\"><strong>[reaction]</strong> (fortune) <strong>Uses 1</strong>\
  \ ❑; <strong>Trigger</strong> You critically fail a Diplomacy check; <strong>Effect</strong>\
  \ You reroll the triggering check and must use the second result. </span></p> \n\
  \      </blockquote> \n      <p>Being able to start a higher-level character—one\
  \ who could still enjoy all of our Tier 1–4 scenarios—was one of the givens when\
  \ we started planning Playtest Point rewards, and even if you'd rather start your\
  \ first character at 1st level, the Experienced Adventurer boon above can give your\
  \ second or third character a jumpstart. Meanwhile, the Initiate's Wayfinder is\
  \ a great opportunity to pick up an otherwise pricey (at least for a 1st-level character)\
  \ piece of equipment that's central to a Pathfinder agent's identity. Also, we'll\
  \ be providing a similar option for wayfinders through other rewards, so playtesters\
  \ aren't the only folks to enjoy this opportunity.</p> \n      <p>The Emergency\
  \ Draught provides an extra edge in survivability when the going gets tough, and\
  \ like many of these rewards, it's a Limited-Use boon that grants a playtester a\
  \ temporary boost without giving a long-term advantage over newer players. Inspired\
  \ by the <em>Doomsday Dawn</em> adventure “Red Flags”, the Red Flags Espionage boon\
  \ shows how some of our boons grant a constant benefit while slotted while also\
  \ giving a limited-use boost in an emergency.</p> \n      <p>And there are more\
  \ rewards besides that you'll see in the coming weeks. When redemption goes live,\
  \ you will find them all on a new tab on your “My Organized Play” page at paizo.com.\
  \ There you can choose what rewards to purchase and which character to assign them\
  \ to, plus a downloadable pdf certificate you can print or save to a digital device.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>We're looking forward to all of the exciting characters you design\
  \ come the launch of the new campaign on August 1st, and it'll be great to see these\
  \ Playtest Point rewards in action!</p> \n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight:\
