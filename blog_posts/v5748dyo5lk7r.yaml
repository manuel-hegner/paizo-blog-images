  \  <p itemprop=\"description\">Ever since <a href=\"/products/btpy9ujg?Starfinder-Alien-Archive\"\
  ><em>Alien Archive</em></a> was announced, the organized play team has received\
  \ a veritable flood of questions concerning the legality of this new book. As was\
  \ <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lk7b?Just-My-Luck-I-Get-Stuck-with-a-Race-that\"\
  >recently revealed</a>, <em>Alien Archive</em> contains 22 new playable races for\
  \ the Starfinder Roleplaying Game. So today, I want to take some time to discuss\
  \ our current and future plans for getting these amazing new alien races into the\
  \ Starfinder Society.</p> \n    <p>First off, I want everyone to know that the \"\
  cantina feel\" is important to the Starfinder Society campaign. We want players\
  \ to have access to a wide array of fun and unique species to create characters\
  \ with. We want those characters to explore the similarly diverse universe that\
  \ is Starfinder. Along with that, we also want to balance the experience for those\
  \ dedicated people behind the GM screen. Most people are still getting acquainted\
  \ with the Starfinder rules, so introducing 22 playable races right away can be\
  \ another layer of complexity for some. So, to start, we will be introducing several\
  \ of the new playable races in a way that shouldn't overwhelm GMs, while still promoting\
  \ some of our core goals for the campaign.</p> \n    <h2>Method 1: Regional Convention\
  \ Support</h2> \n    <p>Conventions are a major source of pride for many communities,\
  \ and we've repeatedly heard from event organizers and venture-officers that access\
  \ to race boons is a big draw for many people attending conventions. We'll be providing\
  \ several <em>Alien Archive</em> races via conventions, but with some additional\
  \ tweaks to make a wider array of races more accessible to people across the world.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>First, over the coming weeks, we'll be creating a group of four informal\
  \ \"mega regions\" that group together existing organized play regions; these are\
  \ just ways for us to organize this distribution, not a new administrative unit\
  \ with assigned leaders. Conventions in each of these larger regions will receive\
  \ a GM reward Chronicle sheet that provides access to a choice of two different\
  \ <em>Alien Archive</em> races, similar to how existing convention support works\
  \ for the Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild but with more options. Because these\
  \ mega regions will have different available races, it should also provide some\
  \ additional incentive to travel to different areas in search of new race boons.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>If you're concerned about missing a desired race boon because it might\
  \ be in a different region, fear not! We're aiming to regularly rotate which races\
  \ are available—roughly every quarter—so that players can still have a chance to\
  \ collect these boons locally, without having to travel outside their region. For\
  \ example, Races A and B might start in Region 1, and Races C and D might start\
  \ in Region 2. After about three months, they might swap so that Region 1 GMs would\
  \ have access to Races C and D.</p> \n    <h2>Method 2: Player Focused Boon</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>For those of you who are not able to attend conventions, we recognize\
  \ that there needs to be other means of accessing playable races. The first method,\
  \ available today, has its roots in the Regional Support Program GM incentive. Rather\
  \ than focusing on GMing, this new Chronicle sheet is entirely based on games played.\
  \ In the same vein as the Regional Support Program, this is a multi-tiered boon\
  \ that will begin by allowing players access to a ryphorian or wrikreechee after\
  \ playing in six unique scenarios with any combination of characters. For those\
  \ holding onto the Chronicle sheet a bit longer, the barathu race becomes available\
  \ after playing 12 unique scenarios.</p> \n    <p>There are some key things to note\
  \ about this boon. First, it is entirely based on games played, so GMing does not\
  \ count towards completion; we have the Regional Support Program and convention\
  \ rewards for GMs. Second, while the boon itself requires that you \"...play an\
  \ adventure for which you have not previously received credit on this boon...\"\
  \ it does provide greater progress for playing sanctioned Adventure Path material.\
  \ Along the same lines, once you apply a boon from this Chronicle sheet to a character,\
  \ the Chronicle sheet is considered used, but you can immediately start filling\
  \ in a new copy of this Chronicle sheet. While standard replay rules apply, you\
  \ can fill in a few of the lines by partaking in repeatable content—so while you\
  \ can't fill these Chronicle sheets out by continually replaying <a href=\"/products/btpy9tsw?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-101-The-Commencement\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society Scenario: #1-01: The Commencement</em></a>, you can still\
  \ get a few extra lines filled from those repeatable adventures when you start filling\
  \ in a new Chronicle sheet.</p> \n    <p>Finally, you'll note that this boon has\
  \ a limited period of validity. This is intentional, as we hope to swap out the\
  \ races on this boon to make more available to the general player base. Given this\
  \ shortened period, it seems appropriate to issue an immediate ruling: previously\
  \ played Starfinder Society scenarios are considered valid and can be applied to\
  \ this Chronicle sheet immediately, so long as they follow the required rules listed\
  \ in the Chronicle sheet. For some of you, this might mean you've already completed\
  \ the Tier 2 requirements and now have access to the associated races—enjoy!</p>\

  \ 3: You Decide the Future</h2> \n    <p>Finally, I want to open up a discussion\
  \ in the comments below about future methods of distributing playable races to our\
  \ players. We're already hard at work planning out scenarios that could allow access\
  \ to new races, as well as other potential events where we can release Chronicle\
  \ sheets opening up further options. But, despite our best-laid plans here on the\
  \ organized play team, I would like to get some feedback on how our players would\
  \ like to see playable races added into the campaign. As we're really just finishing\
  \ our \"First Steps\" (bad pun, sorry) feedback is important, and now is a great\
  \ time to see what you, the players and GMs, think about how we can proceed.</p>\
