  \   <p class=\"date\">Monday, February 11, 2008 </p> \n   <p>One of the problems\
  \ I've seen with most game systems is the necessity of nailing down and quantifying\
  \ a creature's speed. While this is certainly an important value, especially when\
  \ combat begins, it carries with it an unfortunate implication—you're either always\
  \ faster or slower or equally quick when compared to anything else. In other words...\
  \ chase scenes are big problems in RPGs, since those static Speed statistics imply\
  \ that you're either guaranteed to catch a slower foe or that you'll NEVER catch\
  \ a faster foe or a foe that's as fast as you. Which is a shame, since chases have\
  \ such promise to be exciting encounters (as anyone who's seen <i>The French Connection</i>,\
  \ <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>, or any of the <i>Bourne</i> movies can attest.)</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Countless game designers have come up with different ways to simulate\
  \ chase scenes in RPGs over the years—some of their solutions are quick and elegant,\
  \ while others are needlessly complex and dull. In my opinion, chase rules should\
  \ be fast and simple and exciting, and when I realized there's a scene in Nicolas\
  \ Logue's \"Edge of Anarchy\" that had an exciting chase across the rooftop slums\
  \ of Korvosa (a region called \"The Shingles\" by the locals), I knew that here\
  \ was a chance for me to take a stab at coming up with some chase rules of my own.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Alas, I don't have room to go into the details here, but the basic concept\
  \ is this: the region in which the chase takes place is represented by several pieces\
  \ of paper on which are listed skill checks to navigate obstacles. A character can\
  \ opt to just move one piece of paper a turn, or can utilize several different skill\
  \ checks to move two or three pieces in a turn, thus risking a fall or other delay\
  \ in order to close the gap between himself and his quarry. It makes for an even\
  \ more abstract simulation than combat, sure, but in the end, the haste in which\
  \ it all plays out goes a long way toward establishing the high-speed thrill of\
  \ a chase through dangerous terrain. The last thing you want during a chase, after\
  \ all, are bored players!</p> \n   <p> James Jacobs <br> <i>Pathfinder</i> Editor-in-Chief</p>\
