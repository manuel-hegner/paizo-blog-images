  \ Trio</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Friday, January 25, 2008</p> \n   <p>During <a\
  \ href=\"/store/v5748btpy7zdj\">Ulduvai's</a> final days, when its citizens were\
  \ caught in the slow but inevitable decline of their once-great civilization, as\
  \ one by one the other flying cities fell to decadence, disease, conquest, or other\
  \ misfortune, a strange wanderer arrived in the city and brought with him a relic\
  \ of uncertain origin but undeniable power. This mysterious outsider found within\
  \ the city fertile soil: citizens both corrupt enough to submit to perversions that\
  \ others would find unthinkable, and desperate enough to try anything to escape\
  \ a fate that seemed as certain as the stars.</p> \n   <p>Before long, the cult\
  \ had grown to control much of the city, and at its head were three powerful sorcerers.\
  \ On a dark night when the time was right, these three leaders brought the cultists\
  \ together and channeled arcane power through the artifact, seeking to unlock the\
  \ mysteries of creation and become living gods. The results were not what they expected.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Now, centuries later, these three cultists still linger amongst the ashes\
  \ of their former civilization. Each controls a separate area of the city, and each\
  \ is convinced that, given the right tools and enough time, he can return Ulduvai\
  \ to its former glory and banish the chaos that has warped the city almost beyond\
  \ recognition. Yet no matter what they do and what secrets they unlock, they are\
  \ no closer to the answers they seek now than they were on that fateful night centuries\
