  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Hello! Joe Pasini here,\
  \ Neutral Good outsider and Starfinder Lead Designer. As the lead developer for\
  \ <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01zof/\">Alien Archive 3</a>, I got to\
  \ work with a ton of awesome authors to fill the book with weird critters, from\
  \ friendly playable species to colossal threats to all sapient life. I asked a few\
  \ of these folks to talk about their experience writing these creations—take it\
  \ away, designers!</p> <strong>Kate Baker</strong> \n     <p>As Starfinder Society\
  \ players are aware, I am responsible for the psychedelic-colored, four-tusked walrus\
  \ aliens, the morlamaws. If you haven’t had a chance to play Starfinder Society\
  \ Scenario #1-08: <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9x0y?Starfinder-Society-Roleplaying-Guild-Scenario-108-Sanctuary-of-Drowned-Delight\"\
  >Sanctuary of Drowned Delight</a>, then I hope you enjoy your introduction to these\
  \ bizarre but orderly creatures of the deep sea in <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01zof/\"\
  >Alien Archive 3</a>. I certainly didn’t expect when I first wrote them how much\
  \ they were going to resonate with players, and I was delighted to get to expand\
  \ on the morlamaws, their home, and what they’re up to now. I got to ask such questions\
  \ as what kind of musical instruments work underwater and how would morlamaws dance?\
  \ My original task when writing the scenario was to create something memorable and\
  \ distinct from other underwater aliens, and I certainly feel like I succeeded there.\
  \ Hope you all enjoy!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/082219_Morlamaw.png\"\

  \   </div> <strong>Natalie Kertzner</strong> \n     <p>Jinsuls were the Big Bad\
  \ of Starfinder Society Season 1: Year of the Scoured Stars, and they certainly\
  \ had a larger-than-life presence—both as antagonists and as the source of endless\
  \ hashtags like #LegBladesForDays and #VivaKadrical. Despite Season 1 being full\
  \ of aliens, jinsuls were the first species we encountered that felt truly <i>unknown</i>;\
  \ we just didn’t know what they wanted—except to kill us. As creatures created with\
  \ Organized Play in mind, I designed the jinsuls to specifically combat certain\
  \ common builds—casters, operatives, and melee fighters. While no one jinsul can\
  \ counter all of them, I wanted to give GMs the flexibility when building these\
  \ to add in abilities based on the party composition of their players. Even low-level\
  \ jinsuls without extra special abilities are endlessly entertaining, and they toe\
  \ the fun line between “this could really kill us!” and “phew, we took that one\
  \ down!” I hope to see jinsuls spread far across the Starfinder universe, and that\
  \ they stop doing biomedical experiments on adorable sharktopus space puppies. </p>\

  \ <strong>Hilary Moon Murphy</strong> \n     <p>Z-z-zap! Dirindi are an electrically\
  \ attuned race who love to use their spell like ability as a joy buzzer to give\
  \ each other playful zaps in greeting. Those who are not adventurers often have\
  \ no idea how annoying these zaps are to other people. I decided early that dirindi\
  \ playfulness would translate into a love of stories and humor. Their relationship\
  \ with the facts is sometimes hazy, making their newscasts simultaneously wildly\
  \ inaccurate and incredibly popular.</p> \n     <p>Dirindi are one of the two races\
  \ that co-govern the Liavaran moon Arkanen. Collaborating with Katina Davis, who\
  \ wrote Sazarons, we decided that our races were best buddies who complement each\
  \ other well. Dirindis provide creativity, optimism, and ideas, while the scholarly\
  \ sazarons make sure projects stay on schedule and on budget. I hope they spark\
  \ joy in your games.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/082219_Dirindi.png\"\

  \ \n     </div> <strong>Lu Pellazar</strong> \n     <p>I DEFINITELY didn’t just\
  \ write these so I can have one named Kazooie and an uplifted bear named Banjo.\
  \ NOPE NOT AT ALL. In all seriousness, I wrote these charismatic, enigmatic folks\
  \ for those kinds of people in your life that you instantly fall in love with—not\
  \ necessarily romantically, but those that are the life of the party and have that\
  \ uncanny ability to get along with anyone. I met a lot of these kinds of people\
  \ in L.A. We became fast friends, but everyone’s just kinda doing their own thing\
  \ and eventually drift apart. Espraksas are usually in your life short-term, because\
  \ nothing gets in the way of their life goals of traveling the universe and learning\
  \ everything they can before returning to their home world. I guess it’s kind of\
  \ sad, but never fear—espraksa friends will always remember you, and who knows,\
  \ maybe their travels will take them to your home planet!</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  \     </div> <strong>Jessica Redekop</strong> \n     <p>The cephalumes were initially\
  \ created at the Designing Aliens panel of PaizoCon 2018, with Jason Keeley, Lyz\
  \ Liddell, Luis Loza, Joe Pasini, and guest artist Taylor Fischer, where the audience\
  \ and panelists collaborated to develop a creature while Taylor illustrated it.\
  \ It was important to maintain the elements that resonated most with the audience,\
  \ such as their liquid hydrocarbon environment, but also add enough new material\
  \ to still make a fun read for everyone who participated. One of my favourite things\
  \ about the cephalumes is the way they communicate. They 'speak' Lumos, a visual\
  \ language comprised of sequential blinks of their racial bioluminescence. When\
  \ other races communicate in Lumos, I imagine they make clicking sounds, or apply\
  \ tactile pressure, in place of each blink.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
