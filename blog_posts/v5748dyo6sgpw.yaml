  \ </div> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Greetings from Columbus, Ohio! This\
  \ is a brief blog to let you know what the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game doings\
  \ are at <a href=\"https://www.originsgamefair.com\" target=\"_blank\">Origins Game\
  \ Fair</a> (in Columbus) and on <a href=\"https://www.freerpgday.com\" target=\"\
  _blank\">Free RPG Day</a> (at participating retailers worldwide) this weekend.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://originsgamefair.com\" target=\"\
  _blank\"><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20190614-Origins.jpg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>At Origins, there's PACG play in the Franklin Rooms\
  \ pretty much all the time. If you're here and you haven't seen the new <a href=\"\
  /products/btq01ws7?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Core-Set\"><em>Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Card Game Core Set</em></a> and <a href=\"/products/btq01ws8?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Curse-of-the-Crimson-Throne-Adventure-Path\"\
  ><em>Curse of the Crimson Throne Adventure Path</em></a>, now's your chance to dive\
  \ in. Plus, you'll be able to play all 4 scenarios of The Fangwood Thieves, the\
  \ new Season of the Kobolds adventure for Pathfinder Adventure Card Society. (If\
  \ you've never played PACS before, this is a great place to start!) It's a rollicking\
  \ good time.</p> \n     <p>I'll be here throughout the weekend, mostly doing my\
  \ annual nightly broadcast from the Big Bar on 2 with my co-hosts Paul Peterson\
  \ and Gaby Weidling (remember them?). If you like lots of guests and assorted silliness,\
  \ tune into the <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/lonesharkgames\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >Lone Shark Games Twitch channel</a> each night. Last night's broadcast should already\
  \ be up!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"/products/btq01yju?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-We-Be-Heroes\"\
  ><img src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/product/catalog/PZO/PZO9500-16_500.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     </div> \n     <p>And then on Saturday, it's Free RPG Day! As I mentioned\
  \ in <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgki?PACG-Starring-Not-Your-Typical-Goblins\"\
  >a previous blog</a>, we took this opportunity to write a whole new goblin adventure\
  \ using the <em>Core Set</em>! <a href=\"/products/btq01yju?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-We-Be-Heroes\"\
  ><em>We Be Heroes?</em></a> is a weird, wild adventure of good-guy gobbos dealing\
  \ with paladins, undead, and strange chickens. It includes 4 new goblin characters,\
  \ though you can play it with any of the 159 (!) other PACG characters we've released\
  \ over the years. You'll like it. Pick it up at any participating store or try it\
  \ at Origins. If you can't get to one of those locations, though, don't worry—starting\
  \ July 1, you'll be able to download the FREE PDF or buy a print copy from paizo.com.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>We're also pleased to announce that <em>We Be Heroes?</em> is officially\
  \ sanctioned for Pathfinder Adventure Card Society play. Just download this <a href=\"\
  https://paizo-images.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/image/download/PZO9500-16-Rules.zip\"\
  >sanctioning document</a> (218 KB zip/PDF), which describes the adjustments you\
  \ need to make the adventure PACS-legal. (We will soon be issuing similar sanctioning\
  \ documents for <em>The Dragon's Demand</em> and <em>Curse of the Crimson Throne</em>.)</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Since We Be Heroes? is for starting characters, it didn't make sense\
  \ to include roles for our new goblin heroes in that adventure. But we will be releasing\
  \ them online so you can take them all the way through any Adventure Path—if you\
  \ can keep them alive, that is. We're doing something very new for these: One of\
  \ the two roles you can choose for each goblin uses a concept called goblin markers.\
  \ Here's how they work: Each goblin picks a pattern of marker that's theirs. When\
  \ various circumstances occur (such as Crimsi examining a barrier or Siathorn stealing\
  \ an Animal ally from another character), they get to mark their character with\
  \ one of their goblin markers. Feats allow them to count and spend the markers for\
  \ all manner of craziness, such as the Kitbasher Crimsi letting a friend examine\
  \ the top card of a few location decks then move to one of them. (Crimsi's friend\
  \ will probably take only a small amount of damage in the process; I wouldn't worry\
  \ about it too much if I were Crimsi.) There are only 7 of each marker in the box,\
  \ so no goblin can have more than 7—unless you're playing Pizazz, who has a feat\
  \ that lets him swipe a marker from another goblin to heal himself.</p> \n     <p>It's\
  \ going to be a fun weekend! Hope to see you at Origins and Free RPG Day!</p> \n\
