| summary  = 3 kobold miniature figures. On the left, a red kobold holding a staff before him. The staff is pointed on both ends and looks deadly. In the center, a green kobold wields a large dagger in its left hand and a hand crossbow in its right. On the right, a blue kobold appears to be a spellcaster, wielding a staff high in the air in his left hand while a blue 'glow' comes from his right.
