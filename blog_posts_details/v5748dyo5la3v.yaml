  artist: "ferocious protectors who slay any who so much as lay eyes on it. Rumor\
    \ has it that most of these wyrms take all of the treasure with 'em when they\
    \ die, piling it up into one gigantic horde. That'd be enough scratch for you\
    \ and me to buy ourselves a crown or two, eh? Of course, I'm not sure I can tell\
    \ ya without getting a bit of coin in return. For my wife and kids you see...\
    \ this secret is about all we have. I think a thousand gold crowns should be enough.\"\
    \ â€”Conversation with a shifty beggar in the alleys of Kaer Maga GameMastery Module\
    \ J2: Guardians of Dragonfall is due to release later this month. We promise to\
    \ let you have it for a little less than a thousand gold crowns... Jason Bulmahn\
