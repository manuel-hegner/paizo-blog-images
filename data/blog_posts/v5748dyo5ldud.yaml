  \ continue to expand Pathfinder Society to areas where players are looking for organization,\
  \ it’s important to me to find the right people to serve as ambassadors of the game,\
  \ to present it in a positive light for new players and to try to bring veteran\
  \ players who have left back into the fold. Four more Venture-Captains have been\
  \ chosen to fill those roles.</span></p> \n     <p>First, I wanted to note that\
  \ Dan Simons has moved from Washington D.C. to Baltimore. He has resigned his Venture-Captain\
  \ position in Washington D.C. but has taken the mantle as Baltimore’s new Venture-Captain.\
  \ Players in that region are lucky to have an experienced leader to spur growth\
  \ of organized play in their hometown.</p> \n     <p>Taking over as the Washington\
  \ D.C. Venture-Captain is Mike Alchus. He comes into the position extremely motivated\
  \ and well-advised, and is ready to extend his region of responsibility as far south\
  \ as Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania, VA, and as far north as Columbia, MD. If there’\
  s interest, he may also stretch his region out to Leesburg, VA, and possibly Mechanicsville,\
  \ MD.</p> \n     <p>I am also excited to add three new areas to our Venture-Captain\
  \ regions. The first is Oklahoma City. Michael Kirk plans to grow Pathfinder Society\
  \ in Central and Western Oklahoma, as well as North Texas.</p> \n     <p>It also\
  \ is exciting to add both east and west coasts of Canada to the mix. On the east,\
  \ Jonathan Bilodeau will be overseeing growth of Pathfinder Society in Nova Scotia,\
  \ New Brunswick, Newfoundland, and Prince Edward Island. On the west, Anthony van\
  \ Poppelen will be looking to grow Pathfinder Society in all of British Columbia\
  \ north of Quesnel. He will particularly focus on the region in and around the University\
  \ of Northern British Columbia. I am excited to see how much more Pathfinder Society\
  \ can grow in Canada.</p> \n     <p>We’re still in need of additional Venture-Captains\
  \ in some regions, though! Check out the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/about/regionalCoordinators\"\
  >list of regions we're looking for</a> and the first phase of the application process\
  \ on the <a href=\"/pathfinderSociety/getInvolved\">Get Involved!</a> page. If you’\
  re interested in applying, please contact me after reviewing the application process\
  \ in the previous link.</p> \n     <p>Welcome aboard to all my new captains!</p>\
