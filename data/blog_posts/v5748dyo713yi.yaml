  \     </div>\n     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Paizo has built\
  \ itself upon the strength of its adventures—the first offerings we published set\
  \ in the world of Golarion were adventures of different types, ranging from short\
  \ encounters with maps and minis included to classic 32-page softcover standalone\
  \ modules, and of course, the flagship monthly adventure line: Pathfinder. This\
  \ line’s name became the more specific “Pathfinder Adventure Path” two years later\
  \ when we launched the Pathfinder RPG, but ever since that first volume kicked off\
  \ Rise of the Runelords nearly two decades ago, the format has largely remained\
  \ the same. Even as we’ve recently shifted to a focus on three-part Adventure Paths,\
  \ the physical nature of the product hasn’t changed from a softcover 96-page monthly\
  \ softcover book.</p>\n      <p>This format was in part a natural evolution of the\
  \ monthly magazine subscription model of Paizo’s early days as a magazine publisher,\
  \ but it was also a necessary side effect of the work and cost it takes to produce\
  \ an entire campaign. Over the course of 222 months (of which only one was skipped\
  \ a few years ago when we released the double-sized “Seven Dooms for Sandpoint”\
  ), we kept the Adventure Path line going on that regular schedule. But also over\
  \ the course of 222 months, the world has changed.</p>\n      <p>And it’s time for\
  \ the Adventure Path to change with it.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h2>Hardcover Adventure\
  \ Paths</h2>\n      <p>Starting next year, we are transitioning from a softcover,\
  \ serialized, monthly format for Adventure Paths to a quarterly hardcover all-in-one\
  \ format. We’re still committed to publishing four Adventure Paths a year, but these\
  \ will now be published as four separate hardcover books rather than 12 softcover\
  \ books. This will allow a GM to have the entire Adventure Path in hand from the\
  \ start, which should help those who are eager to start their new campaigns on “\
  day 1” of release but who have struggled with how to adjust the adventure for their\
  \ table while not having details for the later parts in hand. It’ll also help friendly\
  \ local game stores keep entire Adventure Paths in stock and will prevent situations\
  \ where parts of an Adventure Path go out of print before others, rendering the\
  \ entire campaign difficult or even impossible for GMs who prefer physical media\
  \ to collect. And from a creative side, it allows us, the writers and developers\
  \ of the Adventure Paths, a lot more freedom in how to present the story—no longer\
  \ do we have the specter of “what if the GM doesn’t have the other book” looming\
  \ over us, forcing us to make decisions on encounters and plots that limit what\
  \ happens in that 96-page softcover to resources found only in that particular section\
  \ of the adventure.</p>\n      <p>A three-part Adventure Path consists of 96 pages\
  \ of content split over three books, for a total of 288 pages in all. The new format\
  \ will start at 256 pages. On its face, reducing overall pages by 32 would seem\
  \ to reduce the amount of content you get in each Adventure Path, but that’s not\
  \ quite accurate, since a single volume is more efficient in several ways. We don’\
  t have to print multiple tables of contents or multiple ORC pages, and the number\
  \ of back-of-the-book advertisements overall will drop from 8 to 12 to potentially\
  \ as few as 2. Adventure Toolboxes will be more efficient, and we’ll have greater\
  \ flexibility in what sorts of support articles we want to include. In the end,\
  \ you’ll still have the same amount of actual adventure content in a 256-page hardcover\
  \ as you did in three 96-page softcovers, but it’ll cost you less overall!</p>\n\
  \      <p>Here are some more facts about the new Adventure Path format:</p>\n  \
  \    <p>• Each volume will be at least 256 pages long—some might be a little longer,\
  \ but we’re hoping to keep them relatively the same length.</p>\n      <p>• Each\
  \ hardcover Adventure Path will present 9 to 10 levels of play, the same as we’\
  ve been doing for the past several years. Our plan is to do at least one a year\
  \ that starts at 1st level, one a year that ends at 20th level, and then with the\
  \ other two, potentially starting anywhere in between.</p>\n      <p>• We’re doing\
  \ four a year, but the release schedules will be a bit flexible—one will come out\
  \ every quarter (so, one in January–March, one in April–June, and so on), but they\
  \ won’t necessarily be separated by three months each time; this allows us more\
  \ flexibility internally when an Adventure Path might be more complicated, but also\
  \ makes it easier to release things in time for conventions or holidays (which don’\
  t always line up in a nice “once every three months” row).</p>\n      <p>• We’ll\
  \ still be doing free downloadable Player’s Guides for each of them!</p>\n     \
  \ <p>• Hardcover formats make it much easier for us to reprint entire Adventure\
  \ Paths if they prove popular, letting us have more time to bring back older out-of-print\
  \ Adventure Paths (like the recently released Gatewalkers Adventure Path compilation)\
  \ rather than reformatting recent three-part APs that happened to sell out while\
  \ still in demand.</p>\n      <p>• A standard hardcover Adventure Path will have\
  \ an MSRP of $79.99, which is less expensive than the current $89.97 price for three\
  \ 96-page softcover volumes. The total price is much less when you factor in potential\
  \ shipping costs split over three books instead of one!</p>\n      <p>In the end,\
  \ this is a change that I’m not only excited to embrace, but thankful. Adventure\
  \ Paths are best enjoyed, in my opinion, all at once, and that can only happen if\
  \ we move away from the older format and embrace the new. It’s certainly a big change,\
  \ but in the end, it’s a good one! I’ll be lurking around in the comments for this\
  \ blog and will be eager to answer additional questions folks have, but in the meantime—\
  here’s a teaser of what we’ve got planned for early 2026’s hardcover Adventure Paths!</p>\n\
  \      <p><strong>Hellbreakers:</strong> A 1st- to 10th-level campaign involving\
  \ the outbreak of the war between Andoran and Cheliax. Can your PCs make the difference\
  \ in this violent clash that threatens two of Golarion’s most bitter rival nations?</p>\n\
  \      <p><strong>Hell’s Destiny:</strong> An 11th- to 20th-level campaign that\
  \ continues the war-torn story from <em>Hellbreakers</em> and can also work on its\
  \ own as a high-powered campaign. Can your PCs stop a truly diabolical threat from\
  \ engulfing the Inner Sea region and casting the continent of Avistan into ruin?</p>\n\

  \ <h2>Pathfinder Organized Play Scenarios</h2>\n      <p>Greetings, Pathfinders!</p>\n\
  \      <p>With the debut of the Year of Battle’s Spark, we’ve made a few changes\
  \ to our standard Pathfinder Society scenario layout to simplify things for GMs\
  \ and ensure more efficient development behind the scenes here at Paizo. For example,\
  \ scenarios will now match our Adventure Path encounter format, with “micro” stat\
  \ blocks for non-custom enemies and hazards found in the <em>Pathfinder Monster\
  \ Core</em> or <em>GM Core</em>. This will keep overall scenario sizes more manageable\
  \ and prevent replication of basic information already presented in the core rules.</p>\n\
  \      <p>We’ve already implemented this change, but there are others on the horizon,\
  \ as well. With the January 2026 release of <em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #7-09:\
  \ The Chitterwood Walks, Part 1: Scrambling the Tribes</em> by Genevieve Rudat Olejnik,\
  \ our scenarios will use a single level band, with this scenario set at levels 3–\
  4. You can expect to see two Pathfinder Society scenarios released each month from\
  \ January onward, with the Year of Battle’s Spark ending with 22 scenarios! Somewhat\
  \ smaller in size than our most recent offerings, these new-format scenarios are\
  \ designed to be run in 3 hours rather than 4, making it easier for event organizers\
  \ to schedule weeknight slots at game stores, where there often aren’t enough hours\
  \ in an evening to squeeze in our current longer scenarios. (Each scenario will\
  \ still award 4 XP and 10 Treasure Bundles, as well as 4 Reputation with your chosen\
  \ faction.) Of course, we’ll continue to endeavor to include juicy roleplaying encounters\
  \ and other opportunities to flex to longer run-times as needed for conventions\
  \ and other venues, but the baseline approach will be toward tighter, more-focused\
  \ adventures.</p>\n      <p>Additionally, we’ll no longer be using challenge points\
  \ to scale encounters. Encounters will be written for six PCs, and we’ll provide\
  \ guidance on offering either a “Harder” or “Easier” experience based on the table\
  \ you’re GMing for! This matches up with changes we’re implementing in Starfinder\
  \ Society and is intended to help streamline the overall experience at the table\
  \ and reduce some of the complexity and GM load in preparation.</p>\n      <p>As\
  \ we’ll be providing more content through the main scenario line, our final quest\
  \ will be <em>Pathfinder Quest #27: Within the Glacier</em> by Kate Tremaine, debuting\
  \ this December. Pathfinder Quests were always intended as introductory short scenarios\
  \ to introduce the campaign to new players, and with nearly 30 of them available,\
  \ there are plenty to choose from. We plan to use some of the resources currently\
  \ aimed at Quests for exciting new Pathfinder Society projects that we’ll be discussing\
  \ in future updates.</p>\n      <p>Thank you for your continued support of the Pathfinder\
  \ Society campaign and for rolling with these new changes. As the line’s primary\
  \ developer, I’m excited about the opportunities provided by the updated scenario\
  \ format and look forward to a bright and exciting future for the campaign!</p>\n\
  \      <p>As we continue to introduce additional updates, we’ll be sure to share\
  \ them here in this space.</p>\n      <p>I’m thrilled for the future of Organized\
  \ Play and can’t wait to share it all with y’all!</p>\n      <p>Until then, remember\
  \ the credo of the Pathfinder Society: Explore! Report! Cooperate!</p>\n      <p\
