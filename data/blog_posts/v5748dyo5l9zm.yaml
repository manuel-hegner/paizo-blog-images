  \ Society Organized Play, Part 4</h1> \n    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, June 17,\
  \ 2008 </p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>The life of a Pathfinder is filled with\
  \ constant peril, but this I can promise: you won't see the shining spires of Alkenstar\
  \ cloistered in some stuffy academy or manning the walls of Absalom in a guardsman's\
  \ helm. <br> —Venture Captain Alissa Moldreserva</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>In\
  \ Part 1, we unveiled our first faction, Andoran, and spoke a little about the faction\
  \ system we'll use in Pathfinder Society Organized Play. In Part 2, we unveiled\
  \ our second faction, Cheliax, and we talked briefly about faction prestige, how\
  \ it's earned, and what it means for the world of Golarion as well as what it means\
  \ for you as a member of the Pathfinder Society. In Part 3, we unveiled the third\
  \ faction for Pathfinder Society Organized Play: Osirion, Land of the Pharaohs.\
  \ For Part 4, we bring you the fourth faction: Qadira, desert frontier kingdom,\
  \ gateway to the massive continent of Casmaron, and the westernmost satrap state\
  \ of the Padishah Empire of Kelesh.</p> \n    <p><b>QADIRA</b><br> Desert Frontier\
  \ Kingdom</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>Let them sit on their thrones and revel\
  \ in their power. They still need spice for their meat, cloves for their breath,\
  \ and incense for their barbaric stench. Let their taxes flow to our golden coffers\
  \ as fast as we can collect them.<br> —Pasha Muhlia Al-Jakri</p> \n    </blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p>The westernmost satrap of the Padishah of Kelesh, Qadira is a kingdom\
  \ with the power of the sprawling Casmaron empire at its back. Qadira is Kelesh's\
  \ doorway to Avistan, and is perhaps the single most valuable piece of real estate\
  \ on Golarion. Rivers of spice and gold flow through its capital of Katheer, and\
  \ Xerbystes II, the Satrap of Qadira, boasts correctly that his kingdom holds the\
  \ wealth of any other three on the Inner Sea. </p> \n    <p>Qadira has long been\
  \ a power to be reckoned with. Taldor has felt the bite of their scimitars and nearly\
  \ lost their entire empire in the struggle. Osirion bowed before them for over three\
  \ thousand years. The war drums of Katheer have been silent for an age, but they\
  \ never stopped waging their wars. Gold is their weapon now, spices are their shield,\
  \ and their incredible trading power is their armor.</p> \n    <p>Qadirans value\
  \ wealth above all else and they seek to make their fortunes abroad. The wealth\
  \ of Absalom, and more importantly the trading opportunities proffered by control\
  \ of the great city, has long drawn the gaze of the satrap's most powerful merchant\
  \ princes. Many Qadirans are ready to leave their deserts behind for the promise\
  \ of lustrous Absalom gold. </p> \n   </blockquote> <a href=\"/image/content/RiseOfTheRunelords/Pathfinder4_Cleric02.jpg\"\

  \ border=\"0\" align=\"right\"></a> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p><b>Goals: No Life\
  \ without Trade</b></p> \n    <p>The world is small and gets smaller everyday. The\
  \ key to power is trade. Qadira couldn't care less who sits on the Grand Council\
  \ of Absalom, so long as the Qadiran trade fleet dominates the harbor. Qadira plans\
  \ to rule the Inner Sea's trade and then bleed their enemies' coffers dry. Collecting\
  \ debts and supplying the demands of other nations' peoples is how Qadira plans\
  \ to rule. If their kingdoms slave to send gold east, the satrapy remains contented.\
  \ </p> \n    <p><b>Methodology: All that Glitters is Power</b></p> \n    <blockquote>\
  \ \n     <p>You can always pay someone to murder your enemies.<br> —Pasha Muhlia\
  \ Al-Jakri</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>The Qadiran faction seeks trade and\
  \ economic advantage above all else. They seek to break their enemies' monopolies\
  \ and enforce their own. They offer wares and goods no one else can supply and destroy\
  \ competition with a ruthlessness that put the devil-bowing Chelish to shame. Qadiran\
  \ missions involve a greater plan, usually embarrassing or defaming an economic\
  \ rival, or ruining the business of another nation's trade companies. </p> \n  \

  \ Society Organized Play.</p> \n    <p>Joshua J. Frost<br> Director of Sales &amp;\
