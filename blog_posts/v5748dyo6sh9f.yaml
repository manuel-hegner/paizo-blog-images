  ><em>Galaxy Exploration Manual</em></a>, the past year and upcoming 12 months’ hardcover\
  \ books keep bringing new reasons for excitement!</p> \n      <p>So forgive my Zo!-like\
  \ theatrics in saying: “But wait, there’s more!” </p> \n      <p>That’s right! Why\
  \ pine longingly for amazing 2021 content when you could playtest it this summer?\
  \ Beginning in <b>July 2020</b>, Paizo is launching not one—but two—different Starfinder\
  \ playtests, opening up new possibilities for your gaming experience and inviting\
  \ you to become part of the creative process! Final versions of both playtests’\
  \ contents will appear in an upcoming, yet-to-be-announced book.</p> \n      <h3>A\
  \ New Class!</h3> \n      <p>As a guiding philosophy when designing new classes,\
  \ the Starfinder team is always pushing to expand innovative ideas and territory:\
  \ the biohacker brings a new spin to the scientist trope, the vanguard weaponizes\
  \ the multiverse’s fundamental energies to redirect damaging forces, and witchwarper\
  \ takes a fresh approach to magic, superimposing alternate realities to create supernatural\
  \ effects. Naturally, an additional class we’d make would want to meet or exceed\
  \ those standards for conceptual novelty, visual wow-factor, and fun at the game\
  \ table. It’s a high bar!</p> \n      <p>Enter the nanocyte.</p> \n      <p>The\
  \ nanocyte’s body houses nanites in untold numbers, granting them impossible strength,\
  \ transforming into tools, and coursing between obstacles to overwhelm their foes.\
  \ The same nanites can reshape the nanocyte’s body to avoid harm as easily as they\
  \ reconfigure features to conceal their presence or mask a lie, making the nanocyte\
  \ an adept combatant and infiltrator able to manifest weaponry at a moment’s notice.\
  \ Whether their powers stem from excruciating experiments, accidental infection,\
  \ or voluntary symbiosis, the nanocyte’s nanites grow stronger by the day as the\
  \ character evolves into a being more machine than mortal.</p> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/061720_SFBlog.jpg\"\

  \ <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p> \n      <h3>A New Way to Play!</h3> \n    \
  \  <p>Starfinder allows for so many stories and ways to play: infiltrating an embassy\
  \ ball, trading shots across a shell-cratered battlefield, racing after villains\
  \ in futuristic vehicles, soaring through space in elegant starships, and more!\
  \ But since Starfinder’s debut in August 2017, the fans have echoed the same question:\
  \ Where are the mechs? Sure, Starfinder provides powered armor that enhances a user’\
  s natural abilities, and there are even a few larger powered armor suits that give\
  \ that tower-over-the-opposition feel. Yet the game so far lacks the ability to\
  \ pilot that giant robot, that titanic vehicle whose power far exceeds that of its\
  \ pilot.</p> \n      <p>Not anymore! In July Starfinder will publicly playtest new\
  \ mech rules, allowing PCs to jump into single-seat mechs or team up with friends\
  \ in even larger behemoths to stomp, fly, and jump-jet around the battlefield! Mech\
  \ combat is designed to use most of the familiar tactical rules and 5-foot squares\
  \ you already use in your games, making mechs a feature you can as easily drop into\
  \ a single encounter as you can build entire campaigns around them. And as you would\
  \ expect, mechs represent a significant power boost, allowing PCs to take on far\
  \ greater challenges than they might on their own—just what you’d expect from a\
  \ system that lets you customize your mechs’ frames, limbs, armaments, power cores,\
  \ and more!</p> \n      <p>Get excited and follow along for more updates! The action\
  \ begins this July!</p> \n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold;\
