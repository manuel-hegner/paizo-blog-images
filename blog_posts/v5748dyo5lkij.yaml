  \  </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">If you haven't heard the stereotypes,\
  \ Seattle has a rather dreary reputation for being constantly cloudy, rainy, chilly,\
  \ and damp. That's only about 80% true; our summers (starting a little before <a\
  \ href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon</a>) are quite beautiful and warm. However, it's around\
  \ late February that I'm rather desperate for the feel direct sunlight and warmth.\
  \ Apparently this month's scenarios got the memo, and both involve a swelteringly\
  \ welcome break from the northern hemisphere's winter.</p> \n    <p>In the first,\
  \ author Nicholas Wasko takes us down to the rough-and-tumble port of Bloodcove,\
  \ the heart of Aspis Consortium activity in the Mwangi Expanse. <a href=\"/products/btpy9y4k?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-9-15-The-Bloodcove-Blockade\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9–15: The Bloodcove Blockade </i></a>is a Tier\
  \ 3–7 scenario that continues an ongoing storyline that began in Season 8. The Consortium's\
  \ up to its usual tricks of exploiting the Mwangi Expanse's mineral and cultural\
  \ resources, but lately the organization's taken an interest to a particular site\
  \ in the Kaava Lands. The catch? Much like how tree roots anchor the soil, these\
  \ ruins and the surrounding jungle have kept a powerful fiend locked away. As a\
  \ result, the Society's trying to shut down the Consortium's imminent strip-mining\
  \ scheme for more than just ecological conservation. That means sneaking into Bloodcove\
  \ to sabotage the operation, and the Exchange faction's itching to leverage its\
  \ economic muscles to blockade the port and strangle out the Consortium's dangerous\
  \ plans. Naturally, Exchange faction PCs have a special opportunity here, courtesy\
  \ of Guaril Karela.</p> \n    <p>Nicholas Wasko's done a nice job with this adventure,\
  \ which involves lots of urban danger, a dash of intrigue, and a lot of dealing\
  \ with fun NPCs. What I really appreciate here is his attention to detail in portraying\
  \ Bloodcove, which straddles the silt-choked Vanji River and is built atop an extensive\
  \ grove of mangrove trees. Not only does the mangroves' flavor play an important\
  \ part in several encounters—such as with the illustrated Erwyn Harvacus, leader\
  \ of a druid circle who keeps the ever-growing mangroves from swallowing the city—\
  but it's also beautifully depicted in the scenario's custom map by Robert Lazzaretti.</p>\

  \ it's no surprise when traveling toward the equator leads to warmer weather. We're\
  \ playing a fantasy RPG, aren't we? Where's the supernatural weather? Where's the\
  \ ritual to inject the sweet relief of spring into winter's cold clutches? Look\
  \ no further than <a href=\"/products/btpy9y4j?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-9-14-Down-the-Verdant-Path\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #9–14: Down the Verdant Path</i></a>, a Tier 1–\
  5 scenario by Scott Sharplin. Ever since <a href=\"/products/btpy9ch0?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-6-15-The-Overflow-Archives\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #6–15: The Overflow Archives</i></a>, we've known\
  \ that Scott has a special talent for telling stories with whimsical themes, and\
  \ #9–14 is no exception. <a href=\"/products/btpy9y4j?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-9-14-Down-the-Verdant-Path\"\
  ><i>Down the Verdant Path</i></a> takes the PCs to Andoran, where they must untangle\
  \ the secrets behind a strange weather phenomenon: in the middle of winter, there's\
  \ a verdant explosion of summer weather! The PCs' journey takes them into the depths\
  \ of the Verduran Forest and beyond, introducing them to a host of \"colorful\"\
  \ characters like the gnome Azure (pictured here).</p> \n    <p>What else is special\
  \ about <i>Down the Verdant Path</i>? It's the first ever adventure to include a\
  \ Concordance of Elements (i.e. \"the Concordance\") special faction opportunity!\
  \ Back in December <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lkbr?Introducing-the-Concordance-Faction\"\
  >we announced the new Concordance faction</a>, dedicated to maintaining the elemental\
  \ balance of the cosmos, studying the multiverse's natural complexity, and calming\
  \ areas of elemental instability. For the Concordance's debut, we wanted to reinforce\
  \ that the faction's more than just a \"nature faction\" eager to hug pixies and\
  \ high-five druids. No, this organization recognizes that even natural forces can\
  \ grow wildly out of control and require intervention, and that's just what you\
  \ get to do in this scenario. We're excited to see how the faction grows and what\
  \ you think of it.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20180228-Azure.jpg\"\
