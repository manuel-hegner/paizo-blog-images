  \    </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">“This stretch\
  \ of coastline is straight as Abadar’s hair part. We’ll just have to go in full\
  \ sail and fuse-ready, and hope the conjured fog gets us close enough.” Shimali\
  \ Manux drummed her fingers on her cabin’s fold-out desk, glowering at a map of\
  \ Chelaxian waters like it had spat in her tankard. Esidries, her first mate, ran\
  \ a hand through her long, shaggy hair, then adjusted her eyepatch. She seemed to\
  \ have her own grievances with cartography.</p> \n     <p>Well… Shimali’s face spread\
  \ its wings into a smile. She was admiral of the Vidric navy, a hero of the Cart\
  \ Fire Uprising that had sparked the revolution. One of only a handful of Firebrands\
  \ with their fourth mark. <em>This is the exact kind of trouble you go looking for,\
  \ isn’t it?</em></p> \n     <p>It was the night before their planned attack on the\
  \ Chelaxian port of Laekastel. A little raven had brought word that the Bellflower\
  \ Network was ferrying a number of recently liberated families into the port from\
  \ Westcrown, then on to freedom in Andoran.</p> \n     <p>The dottari were apparently\
  \ less than thrilled. The Salt Breakers, among them Shimali and Esidries’s host\
  \ ship, the <em>Sunburst Shackle</em>, had been called in to head off any Thrunic\
  \ naval efforts. But the diabolists had moved faster than expected—Laekastel was\
  \ now under blockade.</p> \n     <p>Hence the last-minute tactical discussions between\
  \ Shimali, Esidries, and an irksomely frank and accurate map. There was more than\
  \ enough to consider. By the time they settled on details, the sun was filling the\
  \ sea with fire and molten gold. They’d crafted a sound plan. The rest was up to\
  \ the crews, captains, and Desna herself.</p> \n     <p>“And if it doesn’t work…\
  ” Shimali said through a lopsided grin.</p> \n     <p>Esidries was smiling now,\
  \ too. She recognized Shimali’s expression—the one that meant her sharp-fanged intellect\
  \ could smell prey.</p> \n     <p>“...the best tales tackle tall odds,” Esidries\
  \ finished, lifting an imaginary tankard. Shimali laughed, tapping her own mock\
  \ vessel against her first mate’s, and the two knocked back their airy beverages.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“What’ve you brought this time, Admiral?” Esidries cocked her chin at\
  \ a small box holding down one corner of the map. Shimali’s mementos. There was\
  \ a much larger collection back in Anthusis, but she always brought a few with her\
  \ on these three-day ‘I’m just a crewmate like anyone else’ tours.</p> \n     <p>She\
  \ rolled her eyes. “Mention rank again and I’m pushing you through that window.\
  \ I get enough <em>Admiral</em> above deck.” She undid the little wooden chest’\
  s simple latch and lifted the lid.</p> \n     <p>Her expression softened. “You remember\
  \ these?” She pulled a crumpled metal spike from the box, followed by a quilted\
  \ square in a flower pattern. “One of our first Bellflower undertakings. Much more\
  \ helpful coastline than this blighted stretch”</p> \n     <p>Esidries chuckled.\
  \ “I remember that armiger’s face when you sidestepped his flail and he caved in\
  \ the lictor’s pauldron, yes.” She hid a smile in her drink. “How is the Order of\
  \ the Chain these days? I’m sure they keep in touch—you made quite the first impression.”\
  </p> \n     <p>She was waiting for a quick-witted retort, but none came. The admiral\
  \ had lifted a necklace from the chest, a blue and red cord threaded with rounds\
  \ of broken bone. Her eyes had gone far away and long ago.</p> \n     <p>Esidries\
  \ nodded. She knew the expression. Had worn it herself, on plenty of occasions.\
  \ Sadness, solemnity. And hope, a brilliant flag waving in a clear sky.</p> \n \
  \    <center>\n      <hr width=\"75%\">\n     </center> \n     <p>Eleder was chaos.\
  \ Embers, smoke, and screams choked the air above the Sargavan colonial capital,\
  \ while the clamor of fighting and the smell of brimstone filled its alleys. The\
  \ revolutionaries had almost pushed through to the baron’s palace. They’d charged\
  \ into New Haliad with a fury stoked by centuries of oppression. But the dottari\
  \ kept coming, and now they were getting surrounded.</p> \n     <p>Shimali, Esidries,\
  \ and some two dozen of their Salt Breakers were high above the plaza surrounding\
  \ the plaza, crouched behind a red-shingled roofline. This was the tipping point.\
  \ The fulcrum of her people’s future. She could feel it in the air, read it on her\
  \ comrades’ faces.</p> \n     <p><em>This would be the perfect time for a rousing\
  \ speech</em>, she thought. But she was too tired, too sore. She simply looked back\
  \ at her Salt Breakers and nodded. They vaulted the roofline.</p> \n     <p>Coats\
  \ and hair flapping behind them, they careened down the shingles and into the plaza.\
  \ Righteous anger thundered from them as a wordless roar. Shimali felt the crunch\
  \ of a soldier’s neck beneath her boot. Before she could register the symbolism,\
  \ they were in the thick of it.</p> \n     <p>The Salt Breakers pushed into the\
  \ rear of the Thrunite formation, the beleaguered revolutionaries’ cheers driving\
  \ them on. Esidries laid into the Chelaxians with a miner’s pick she’d acquired\
  \ somewhere along the way. Each blow punched through steel and flesh and sent tremors\
  \ up her arm. Shimali’s cutlass penned its own red-inked story.</p> \n     <p>“\
  Shimali!”</p> \n     <p>She barely heard Esidries’s cry in time. She whirled around,\
  \ her blade only just turning aside the longsword meant for her guts. The dottari\
  \ staggered into her. His breath was hot on her face, heavy with the smell of the\
  \ whisperleaf caked to his gums. His eyes held surprise and hatred in equal measure.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>She drove her forehead into his nose, shoved him aside. Her sword shrieked\
  \ across the breastplate of another charging soldier. The sound almost masked the\
  \ crash of armored boots approaching from behind. Without looking, she drew her\
  \ pistol and fired. Her desperation was rewarded with the sound of two hundred pounds\
  \ of bootlicker clattering to the ground. She shared a wide-eyed <em>I can’t believe\
  \ that worked</em> grin with Esidries, offering a silent prayer to Desna and Lubaiko\
  \ both.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/2d37a55d-349c-47e4-84b9-85309b36edda/230303_FirebrandFiction_2000.jpg\"\

  \     </div> \n     <br> \n     <p>Then fresh Hell arrived. The air above the plaza\
  \ split and screamed. A fiery gash shrieked open, becoming a burning eye with a\
  \ bone-white pupil.</p> \n     <p>Shimali’s blood ran cold. She could <em>taste</em>\
  \ the wrongness of the extraplanar intrusion, something caustic at the back of her\
  \ throat.</p> \n     <p>“Bone devil! Gods-damned bone devil!” Her fear was galvanizing.\
  \ “Rally! Rally for loved ones, for home. For throwing off the yoke of Hell!”</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The fiend pulled itself free of the rift, landing hard enough to crack\
  \ paving stones. It stood its full height, almost level with the rooftops. It threw\
  \ its head back and let loose an ear-splitting challenge that shattered nearby windows\
  \ and sent shivers down Shimali’s spine.</p> \n     <p>She surveyed the beleaguered\
  \ revolutionaries picking their way over colonialist corpses. They were already\
  \ taking up position, surrounding the infernal monstrosity. Esidries was beside\
  \ her—<em>just like always</em>—weaving sigils in the air, a Magaambyan winter-song\
  \ chiming its way off her tongue.</p> \n     <p>She charged.</p> \n     <center>\n\
  \      <hr width=\"75%\">\n     </center> \n     <p>“You know, I tell people that\
  \ story and they don’t believe me. ‘You can’t take down a bone devil with pitchforks\
  \ and adrenaline,’ they tell me. ‘Tall as a house and made of hate, there’s no way!’\
  ” Esidries snorted in mock exasperation. “But if <em>Shimali Manux</em>, hero of\
  \ the revolution, tells it, well. You’d think my record would—”</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ <em>Sunburst Shackle</em> lurched to one side so hard that it took them a few\
  \ moments to realize they were sprawled on the floor. Shimali swatted the map off\
  \ her face, cursing the pen, the ink, and the person responsible for the miserable\
  \ thing. She hauled herself to her feet then helped Esidries to hers. The cabin\
  \ was a wreck, but at least her sword and gun were still hanging on the wall. They\
  \ exchanged a knowing look, grabbed their weapons, and rushed abovedecks.</p> \n\
  \     <p><em>We’re still leagues from Laekastel—how did they find us? Worse, how\
  \ did they get the drop on us?</em></p> \n     <p>The answer came as soon as she\
  \ surfaced beneath the night sky. Panic crackled across the deck. A sailor, clothes\
  \ completely dry, coughed a staggering amount of murky seawater at her feet.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><em>Sarglagons</em>.</p> \n     <p>And there they were. The sea between\
  \ the ships churned with piscine horrors. Iridescent magenta fins, writhing hands,\
  \ and the razored maws of Hell’s darkest depths—drowning devils. A handful were\
  \ attempting to capsize the <em>Sunburst Shackle</em>. Shimali could hear the chattering\
  \ of others attacking the rest of the fleet.</p> \n     <p>It had been years since\
  \ Vidrian’s birth in fire, and Shimali had grown into her role as commander. She\
  \ straightened, spread her arms wide, and strode resolutely toward the deck.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Salt Breakers! House Thrune wants to strangle the cry for freedom,\
  \ bind the world in iron and fear! Drown us in blood!” The power in her voice cut\
  \ through the din of battle. She clapped the retching sailor on the shoulder, stopped\
  \ long enough to acknowledge the determination in their eyes. “But there’s Gozreh’\
  s gift in our veins! Iron in our spines! Phoenix flames in our hearts!”</p> \n \
  \    <p>She could feel the energy shifting as the crew rallied. She just needed\
  \ to get to the wind-singer, start fighting fire with magical fire. <em>If Shattering\
  \ Howl starts the song, we—</em></p> \n     <p>The air above the deck split and\
  \ screamed. Bone-white claws gouged a hole between worlds, and she could see flashes\
  \ of black wings and a scorpion’s fleshless tail.</p> \n     <p>Then a second rift\
  \ opened. Followed by another, and another. Shimali’s skin crawled as the heat and\
  \ stench of Hell poured over the deck.</p> \n     <p>“The best tales…” Esidries\
  \ stepped up beside her, hands already crafting a spell.</p> \n     <p>“...tackle\
  \ tall odds,” Shimali finished. She grinned at her first mate. “And what self-respecting\
  \ Firebrand settles for less than the best?”</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p style=\"\
