  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">I've made no secret of the\
  \ fact that Sandpoint, the scene of the action in the first Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Path adventure, <i>Burnt Offerings</i>, was based in large part on my hometown\
  \ of Point Arena, California. Some elements, such as the town dump consisting of\
  \ \"just throw your trash off the cliff into the ocean,\" huge cliffs surrounding\
  \ a perfect little cove, the presence of a large theater in a relatively small town,\
  \ or the mirror posted just outside of town that sports a sign asking visitors to\
  \ see themselves as the townsfolk see them first are from Point Arena's real-world\
  \ history. And then there's the fact that the town's original name translated roughly\
  \ into \"Sand Point\"... although time and the tides have long since washed away\
  \ the point bar of sand that once protected the harbor.</p> \n     <p>But most of\
  \ Sandpoint came from my imagination, and that includes its diverse cast of citizens.\
  \ In <i>Burnt Offerings</i> I was able to explore several of these characters and\
  \ locations, but for many of Sandpoint's locals I was only able to scratch the surface.\
  \ I never had room to go into full detail about the extent and dangers found in\
  \ the old smuggler's tunnels below town, who's been leaving birthday presents for\
  \ Rynshinn at Vernah's Fine Clothing, or exactly what drove Jervis Stoot to become\
  \ a relentless serial killer, but that doesn't mean I didn't have an idea even at\
  \ the time what was going on.</p> \n     <p>With <a href=\"/products/btpya21b?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Sandpoint-Light-of-the-Lost-Coast\"\
  ><i>Sandpoint: Light of the Lost Coast</i></a> I can finally pull back the curtain\
  \ and expose some, but not all, of Sandpoint's secrets. It was a blast finally getting\
  \ to set these mysteries down on paper for others to explore, and just as fun to\
  \ make my own discoveries along the way. I'd never given any thought as to what\
  \ danger might lurk near the headwaters of the Turandarok River, for example, or\
  \ figured out exactly why a ghost haunts Biston's Pond in the hinterlands. As I\
  \ got to these locations and more while writing about them, their stories seemed\
  \ almost to write themselves.</p> \n     <p>In fact, I wrote a lot more than I could\
  \ ever fit into even a 96 page book. There's plenty more to find out about Sandpoint,\
  \ and in time, and if I can pester the right folks to help make it happen, I'd love\
  \ to present the nearby complex known as \"the Pit\" in the format of a deluxe adventure.\
  \ I've already run this adventure once for several folks here at the office in my\
  \ old <i>Shadows Under Sandpoint</i> campaign. Many of the elements of that campaign,\
  \ from the Red Bishop to Pillbug Podiker's antics are direct results of that campaign.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Anyway, here's hoping that you all enjoy your upcoming visit to Sandpoint\
  \ as much as I enjoyed setting the place up for you to explore! Have fun, enjoy\
  \ the curried salmon and raspberry ale, and keep watching out for that pesky Sandpoint\
  \ Devil!</p> \n     <p>PS: Check out what might be one of my favorite pieces of\
  \ art we've ever publishedâ€”a bird's eye view of the town itself! I can totally see\
  \ my house from here!</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderCampaignSetting/20181004-Sandpoint.jpg\"\
