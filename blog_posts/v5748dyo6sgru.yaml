  \ again, everyone! It's your mostly-fearless-except-for-fear-of-falling-from-heights\
  \ Venture Captain for online Pathfinder Adventure Card Society, Tyler!</p> \n  \
  \   <p> I had a blast at PaizoCon, and we got LOADS of new information from Paizo\
  \ on the release of the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws7?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Core-Set\"\
  >Core Set</a> and the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws8?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Curse-of-the-Crimson-Throne-Adventure-Path\"\
  >Curse of the Crimson Throne Adventure Path</a> (both available now), on the new\
  \ Year of Rotting Ruins that begins at Gen Con, and on the fact that the Core and\
  \ Curse scenarios in the storybooks that come in the box are sanctioned for PACS\
  \ play! I also want to give a quick plug for the current online PACS play-by-post\
  \ convention, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/threads/rzs42l1o?Announcing-Player-Recruitment-for-Cards\"\
  >Cards Against Gnomanity II</a>. Though the event has already begun, we'd love to\
  \ have you join us for future games, so if you just tell us in the recruitment thread\
  \ that you're interested, we can help you find a game—even if you've never played\
  \ PACS through play-by-post! </p> \n     <p> Mostly, though, I want to talk to you\
  \ a bit about something that I spent several months working on leading up to PaizoCon,\
  \ and then spent most of my actual time at PaizoCon running: this year's homebrew\
  \ special, entitled \"I Want My Mummy!\" </p> \n     <p> This set of three adventures\
  \ was designed to run during three afternoon sessions at PaizoCon. We decided this\
  \ year to do Tier 1, Tier 3, and Tier 5 so that people got a broader taste of the\
  \ characters. The story is based on some of the most popular PFS scenarios from\
  \ WAAAY back in season 5: <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy93m0?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-5-12-Destiny-of-the-Sands-Part-1-A-Bitter-Bargain\"\
  >the Destiny</a><a> </a><a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy93m3?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-5-15-Destiny-of-the-Sands-Part-2-Race-to-Seekers-Folly\"\
  >of the Sands</a> <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy93m4?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-5-16-Destiny-of-the-Sands-Part-3-Sanctum-of-the-Sages\"\
  >trilogy</a>. This means that your kobold characters (new versions of the infamous\
  \ kobolds from <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9cu6?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-6-99-True-Dragons-of-Absalom\"\
  >True Dragons of Absalom</a>) get to interact with everyone's favorite creepy dude\
  \ in a hot tub, Grandmaster Torch. He'll send your kobolds on a grand adventure\
  \ to… do a bunch of seemingly mundane tasks for him, as is tradition. </p> \n  \

  font-size: 13px;\">The kobold Alchemist, Athrax. There's no \"n\" in there… read\
  \ it again, I promise you it's true.</p> \n     </div> \n     <p> As you can see\
  \ from his character and role cards, Athrax uses the trap-setting mechanic to keep\
  \ from banishing his Alchemical items. He also has a few spells, but he just straight-up\
  \ banishes those, so it's best to keep things like Cure and Find Traps in those\
  \ slots, which can be useful one-shots. Athrax also has a useful way of ignoring\
  \ Triggers, by setting traps and then examining locations. Sometimes it's more than\
  \ worth a buried card to ignore a Trigger. </p> \n     <p> In brief, trapsetting\
  \ works like this: When you set a trap with a card, you display that card next to\
  \ your location (we played them facedown at PaizoCon because we had different-colored\
  \ sleeves for each character, which helps determine who set the trap initially).\
  \ When a monster is encountered at a trapped location, the trap is sprung, and you\
  \ get to add 1d6 to all checks against that monster for the encounter. </p> \n \
  \    <p> After Adventure 1, we skip ahead to Adventure 3, where you're in hot pursuit\
  \ of two Aspis agents who have gotten hold of one of the fabled Sage Gems, mythical\
  \ gems that hold the power of the Jeweled Sages inside them. Several of the scenarios\
  \ in this adventure allow you to gain Chase Points for finishing quickly, culminating\
  \ in a scenario where you're literally chasing the Aspis agents along a set of locations,\
  \ trying to move quickly to the place where another Sage Gem is likely to be found.\
  \ Once you arrive, you find many dangers, the worst of which is the deadly Sage\
  \ of Plagues, who has one of the most diabolical powers I've ever written. When\
  \ you defeat him, he explodes in necromantic energy, shattering the Ruby Sage Gem…\
  \ but even shards of such a powerful relic have the ability to grant incredible\
  \ abilities to those wielding them. </p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> \n \
