  \ Boon Slots</h2> \n    <p>As previously announced in interviews and at our PaizoCon\
  \ panel, Starfinder Society is changing up the Roleplaying Guild's handling of boons.\
  \ Boons are non-standard rewards granted on the Chronicle sheets you get for completing\
  \ Starfinder Society scenarios and sanctioned content. For all you Pathfinder Society\
  \ veterans out there, the current boon system involves finding special boons on\
  \ a Chronicle sheet and mentally keeping track of them throughout the course of\
  \ your character's career. The existing system allows for a character to accrue\
  \ a lot of boons over the course of her career, but it also requires a lot of tracking\
  \ on the player's end. Did you remember that your second Chronicle sheet gave you\
  \ a +1 circumstance bonus to negotiating with gnolls from western Katapesh? (John\
  \ likes using that one as an example, a lot. He also wants me to remind Pathfinder\
  \ Society players, that six seasons later, that boon is still relevant!)</p> \n\
  \    <p>To ease player record keeping burdens, as well as to give the development\
  \ team some flexibility on ensuring that boons remain relevant throughout the campaign,\
  \ Starfinder Society introduces boon slots. Each boon slot represents an available\
  \ space in which a player can activate one of their earned boons; if you've slotted\
  \ a boon, it's active for that adventure, and if you didn't slot one of your boons,\
  \ it's dormant. Every Starfinder Society character has six boon slots, and each\
  \ of which corresponds to a different type of boon. Most boons now include a corresponding\
  \ boon type, so you can slot a Social boon into your Social boon slot, but not into\
  \ your Faction boon slot. This means that with the exception of the occasional untyped\
  \ boon, you'll only be tracking up to six boons during a session—not sorting through\
  \ stacks of paper in the middle of the game.</p> \n    <p>In previous announcements,\
  \ we've talked a little about boon slots, but today we're going to go over each\
  \ of the six types of boons.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>Ally</b>: Ally\
  \ boons are boons that represent an ally actively assisting the PC. This could be\
  \ a temporary hireling versed in a specific skill, an ammunition porter, or even\
  \ a less physical presence <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ljuj?A-Talk-About-Cooperation\"\
  >(such as the digital imp we discussed in our previous blog</a>). Ally boons generally\
  \ represent an additional 'body' on the team, or the presence of a creature that\
  \ affects combat or general skill checks.</p> \n     <p><b>Faction</b>: Every faction\
  \ offers a boon that allows characters to champion that faction. Characters slotting\
  \ these boons earn Reputation with the associated faction, effectively allowing\
  \ the character to swap out what factions she works for on a scenario-by-scenario\
  \ basis. The entry-level boon for a faction's referred to as the champion boon,\
  \ and that can improve as your character gains more and more Reputation.</p> \n\
  \     <p><b>Promotional</b>: Promotional boons are unique in that they often represent\
  \ out-of-game acquisitions that translate to in-game benefits—Pathfinder Society\
  \ veterans might think of this as the \"shirt reroll\" slot. One example of a promotional\
  \ boon, would be a boon designed around bringing a <a href=\"/products/btpy9tmp?Starfinder-Player-Character-Folio\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Player Character Folio</em></a> to use at the table. If you're concerned\
  \ about only being limited to benefiting from one promotional item during an adventure...\
  \ well, let's just say there's a faction that has your back!</p> \n     <p><b>Social</b>:\
  \ These boons encompass agreements or alliances with in-game organizations or NPCs.\
  \ For John's sake, this is where you'll slot that lovely ‘gnolls from western Katapesh'\
  \ boon! A common example of a social boon would be forging a relationship with an\
  \ organization, and in future scenarios that organization returns and reacts differently\
  \ based on whether you've slotted this boon.</p> \n     <p><b>Starship</b>: We sure\
  \ have starships and starship combat in the Starfinder Society Roleplaying Guild.\
  \ The starship boon slot allows characters to customize some of the standard hulls\
  \ available to field agents. Expect a future blog post to touch on exactly how starships\
  \ work in Starfinder Society.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>When does a player\
  \ decide to lock-in his boons for an adventure? Well, Starfinder Society scenarios,\
  \ much like their Pathfinder Society counterparts, include mission briefings. Each\
  \ briefing now ends with an instruction for the GM to inform the players to select\
  \ their boons. This gives players some time in-game to select what boons they think\
  \ will be most appropriate to the mission at hand, based on the information they\
  \ received from the briefing. If you're wondering about missing out on slotting\
  \ story relevant boons, don't worry! The boon slotting section of the adventure\
  \ will also give GM a list of especially relevant boons from previous Chronicle\
  \ Sheets, letting the GM know to inform the players that these boons could have\
  \ a significant effect on the game if they choose to slot them.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  ></a> \n     <p><i>Illustration by Hugh Pindur</i></p>\n    </div> \n    <h2>New\
  \ Races</h2> \n    <p>The most frequent question I've heard about Starfinder Society—\
  not counting head-in-jar joke questions—is how we'll be handling the multitude of\
  \ available races. With the recent release of <a href=\"/products/btpy9tmr?Starfinder-First-Contact\"\
  ><em>Starfinder First Contact</em></a> and the announcement of the <a href=\"/products/btpy9s2l?Starfinder-Alien-Archive\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Alien Archive</em></a>, the Starfinder team is certainly delivering\
  \ on its promise of adding a wide variety of playable races beyond the core seven\
  \ races. So how will Starfinder Society play handle the ever-expanding list of alien\
  \ species?</p> \n    <p>Oh... hmmmm... did I miss one of the boon slots? OH! Well,\
  \ isn't that fortuitous timing! Let me just take a quick detour from this talk on\
  \ alien species to fix that omission.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>Personal</b>:\
  \ Personal boons represent a wide variety of special boons available in the campaign.\
  \ Unique races, typically those found beyond the core races of the Starfinder Core\
  \ Rulebook, commonly occupy this slot. The personal slot often requires associated\
  \ boons (such as new race options) be permanently slotted, so that the slotted boon\
  \ does not change on a scenario-by-scenario basis. However, this also means that\
  \ characters with this boon slot available can use it for other purposes...</p>\
  \ \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Well, that certainly explains a bit, doesn't it?\
  \ Yes, non-standard species will be made available by permanently slotting that\
  \ race's boon in the Personal boon slot. This doesn't mean that every new race will\
  \ be immediately available for use. We're rolling out new races in a controlled\
  \ fashion, such as through convention or special event boons, as well as through\
  \ some unique new distribution plans that we're adding into the campaign. Not quite\
  \ ready to go into all the details on how these boons will be released, but stay\
  \ tuned for more info!</p> \n    <p>Ok, fine, I'll answer one more common question—\
  only because you're all great fans. How will Starfinder Society handle the legacy\
  \ races from Pathfinder? Can you play a halfling starship pilot, or a half-orc solarian?\
  \ How does one get access to play legacy races? Well, here's a hint: Pathfinder\
  \ Society has this cool thing called a \"Regional Support Program\" and Starfinder\
  \ Society will have one too!</p> \n    <p>Alrighty, enough spilling of beans from\
  \ my end. I need to get back to work before John and Tonya find out I've spent all\
  \ this time on an extra-long blog post!</p> \n    <p>Thurston Hillman<br> <i>Starfinder\
