  \ in front of the vast chasm surrounding the Starstone Cathedral was slightly larger\
  \ today than most days. Visitors from all over Golarion stopped by the great pit\
  \ every day to marvel at the ancient edifice at its center, to dream of the stone\
  \ hidden away behind its massive walls, lethal traps, and immortal guardians. It\
  \ was said that the <em>Starstone</em> granted immeasurable power to any who could\
  \ touch its crystalline surface and pass the final test of spirit. Those who succeeded\
  \ became gods. Most simply fell to their deaths in the chasm outside and the rare\
  \ few who made it in the cathedral were usually never heard from again.</p> \n \
  \     <p>Normally, an attempt by one of the “hopeful” would draw a huge crowd of\
  \ locals and visitors alike, all interested to see if the would-be god could even\
  \ make it across the chasm. The celebration was usually all in good fun, if you\
  \ could call someone risking their life for immortality fun, but it could turn unruly\
  \ in an instant, the mob demanding the poor soul fling themselves into danger. In\
  \ either case, it was good business for those of us who ran shops in the Ascendant\
  \ Court, selling sweet treats and chilled wine. </p> \n      <p>But not today. </p>\
  \ \n      <p>Today was the fourth supposedly prophesized moment of ascension for\
  \ Dyrani, and business was terrible.</p> \n      <p>Her first attempt was almost\
  \ a year ago. The Osiriani woman had only been on the Avenue of the Hopeful for\
  \ a few weeks at that time, and although she didn’t have a large throng of supporters,\
  \ she still drew a good crowd to hear her tale and see her make the attempt. For\
  \ over an hour she spoke of her accomplishments, from the moment of her birth under\
  \ an auspicious sign, to the tremendous thunderstorm that bore down upon her parent’\
  s small home giving her a connection to the rains and floods, the crops, and the\
  \ land. The people listened to her claims of connection to the harvest and how she\
  \ could be counted on to bring rain to struggling farmers and ensure a season of\
  \ plenty for all upon her ascension. They even saw her plant a simple seed into\
  \ the ground and encourage it to grow, yet when it came time for her to leap, something\
  \ changed. She looked out at the chasm and declared that it was not the right time.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>“The seed was not yet ready to sprout,” she said, adding that once\
  \ the plant has matured, she would take the test.</p> \n      <p>Suffice to say,\
  \ there were more than a few jeers and cries. But for all the disappointment, Dyrani\
  \ benefitted quite a bit from the show. For the next few months farmers, gardeners,\
  \ and food merchants began to stop by her rustic stall on the Avenue and pay their\
  \ respects to her and the growing plant. They say it never hurts to get in early\
  \ with new gods. Even if only one in a thousand passed the test, those who do are\
  \ sure to remember any who believed in them from the start. For my part, I sold\
  \ a lot of harvest breads and orange tea to her faithful.</p> \n      <div class=\"\

  \   <p>Dyrani even gathered a few devotees to aid in her preparations. She anointed\
  \ each in a grand ceremony, dubbing them the High Priest of Rains, the High Priestess\
  \ of Sowing, and the High Priest of Harvest, respectively. They were mostly harmless,\
  \ wearing ridiculous hats and making pronouncements about the weather. Most would-be-gods\
  \ attracted a few desperate fools, even when they had nothing to give other than\
  \ vague promises about the future. The feeling of importance, of belonging was often\
  \ enough. The avenue was usually cluttered with these supplicants, shouting edicts\
  \ and making the case for their still-mortal deity. It wasn’t bad for business,\
  \ really. Most visitors came just to see this spectacle, even if there was no attempt\
  \ that day. Some of my best days selling sweet pastries have been after a good brawl\
  \ between the high priests of various would-be faiths. No one wins... except us.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>The second attempt was scheduled for later that summer. By this time,\
  \ Dyrani had amassed a vast crowd of followers, and there was a festival happening\
  \ in the Grand Bazaar, so the city was swollen with visitors. The Avenue and the\
  \ Court were packed with people, many of whom began drinking and chanting for Dyrani\
  \ just after dawn. Her High Priests were there of course, collecting tithes in vast\
  \ cornucopias made from straw. From the moment I saw them, I knew it was not going\
  \ to be the day. These hopeful never go through with the test when the coin is flowing\
  \ freely. There’s still too much to be gained. Later that day, the High Priestess\
  \ of Sowing pronounced that Dyrani had read the tea leaves (from my stall no less!)\
  \ and decided that the most auspicious time to take the test would be at the end\
  \ of the harvest, so that she could prove her worth to all the other gods and make\
  \ this year a harvest like no other. Fortunately for the harvest deity, another\
  \ hopeful made the attempt later that afternoon, screaming as he plummeted into\
  \ the void. I think he wanted to be the god of fish or some such nonsense. </p>\
  \ \n      <p>Over the next few months, Dyrani’s appearance changed significantly.\
  \ Gone were her woolen dresses—now she wore elegant silk embroidered with golden\
  \ wheat. Her simple grapevine crown was replaced with a wreath of bejeweled golden\
  \ leaves, and now she carried a massive silver scythe, so that all might know that\
  \ the goddess of the harvest was near. It had been a good few months for her and\
  \ her faithful, as the donations came flooding in from visitors and locals alike.\
  \ But as the end of the harvest drew close, there were signs of stress. </p>\n \
  \     <p>The High Priest of Rains quit one afternoon after a heated debate about\
  \ the upcoming attempt. I think I saw him making poses at the end of the avenue,\
  \ worshipping another perpetual hopeful. The High Priestess of Sowing stopped working\
  \ the street for donations after a local gang stole her cornucopia. Only the High\
  \ Priest of Harvest remained loyal, doing whatever was asked, but he was a zealot,\
  \ having lost his entire family to famine some years back. I wouldn’t be surprised\
  \ if he leapt into the pit after Dyrani on her day.</p> \n      <p>When harvest\
  \ finally came, the crowd was sizable, but it was clear most didn’t think Dyrani\
  \ would actually go through with it. All were disappointed when the sacred plant\
  \ was revealed. It was withered and brown. Defeated, Dyrani called off the attempt,\
  \ claiming she had been sabotaged by agents of Urgathoa, who wouldn’t dare let such\
  \ a powerful deity ascend. The boos were some of the loudest I’ve ever heard. Nearly\
  \ all her supplicants quit in the following days, stealing her finery and looting\
  \ her treasury.</p> \n      <p>It was a hard winter for the would-be goddess. By\
  \ the spring, it was just her and the High Priest of the Harvest. Their clothes\
  \ were stained, and the silver scythe had been tarnished.</p> \n      <p>And that\
  \ brings us to today. My shop is toward the end of the Avenue, right across from\
  \ the vast chasm surrounding the Cathedral. The spectacle is all but gone. Dyrani\
  \ has drawn right up to the edge. There’s no cheering, no chants, just silence and\
  \ the sound of the wind. As the clouds break, a shaft of sunlight illuminates the\
  \ young woman. She looks exhausted, as most do after their long journey down the\
  \ Avenue, but as she looks up into the sun, its warmth shining upon her, she steps\
  \ out, over nothing…</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p style=\"font-weight: bold;\
