  \ Appendix – F. Wesley Schneider (Part 2)</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday,\
  \ July 23, 2009</p> \n   <p>Presented here is the second part of my interview with\
  \ Pathfinder Managing Editor F. Wesley Schneider about the sources of inspiration\
  \ he would include in Paizo's own Appendix N. In this part, he discusses how Golarion\
  \ was created to accommodate a wide variety of influences and inspirations, and\
  \ lists his most recent favorite gothic horror authors!</p> \n   <p><b>David</b>:\
  \ So how did the influences of mythology affect the design of Golarion?</p> \n \
  \  <p><b>Wes</b>: Well, Golarion is meant to be a place where you can have everything.\
  \ It's not just a place for editors' pet projects—gamers should be able to run whatever\
  \ type of game they want in the setting. However, we have only shown 1/16 of the\
  \ entire world of Golarion, and future products will open new doors for influences\
  \ and inspiration.</p> \n   <p><i>D&amp;D</i> for the last 30 years has been a fantastic\
  \ thief, stealing ideas from mythology, folklore, and pulp fantasy and horror. Golarion\
  \ is similar in this regard, as you can see many of the same trappings in our own\
  \ setting. But we also are trying to present things that people haven't seen before,\
  \ like a land of devil-worshipers where people live in fear but order has been maintained;\
  \ or a land where religion has been outlawed, despite the very real presence of\
  \ the gods; or a land where questionable eugenics are being used for the supposed\
  \ betterment of humanity. The wide variety of styles and influences is obvious enough\
  \ when you look at the titles of each nation–Numeria, for example, is described\
  \ as the \"Savage Land of Super-Science.\" The influence of things like <i>Thundarr\
  \ the Barbarian</i> is very clearly present. Despite any obvious influences, however,\
  \ Golarion is meant to fuel ideas for stories and campaigns; rather than present\
  \ a story for you to participate in, the approach we wanted to take with the setting\
  \ was \"here is an interesting locale in which to <i>tell</i> a story.\" </p>\n\
  \   <p><b>David</b>: Give me a quick list of some things that have recently inspired\
  \ your game design.</p> \n   <p><b>Wes</b>: Off the top of my head, I've really\
  \ enjoyed Sheridan Le Fanu's stories. Among other things, he's famous for writing\
  \ <i>Carmilla</i>, a vampire story that predated and influenced Bram Stoker's <i>Dracula</i>.\
  \ I've also been reading M. R. James's work; he wrote tons of ghost stories that\
  \ have quietly influenced hundreds of stories and movies like <i>The Twilight Zone</i>\
  \ and the recent film <i>Drag Me To Hell</i>. I also recently discovered the artist\
  \ and author Wayne Barlowe in my research for the <i>Book of the Damned Volume I</i>,\
  \ who greatly influenced my take on Hell.</p> \n   <p>James Jacobs and Pierce Watters\
  \ also introduced me to the old Hammer Horror movies—they have terrible acting and\
  \ even worse special effects, but the ideas presented in many of these movies are\
  \ <i>amazing</i>. <i>The Devil Rides Out</i> has been one of my favorites so far:\
  \ Christopher Lee fights a cult trying to summon the Devil. Awesome!</p> \n   <br>\
  \ \n   <p>Thus ends my interview with Wes Schneider, Paizo's resident expert on\
  \ the intersection of folklore and horror. And this wraps up interviews with Paizo's\
  \ editorial pit. Thanks a ton to all the designers and to all of you for reading!</p>\
