  \ closer to the release of <a href=\"/products/btpy9nfu\"><em>Pathfinder Module:\
  \ Gallows of Madness</em></a>, which means it's finally time to reveal some of the\
  \ maddeningly enticing tidbits this book has to offer!</p> \n    <p itemprop=\"\
  description\">And there is a lot to be excited about. For starters, <em>Gallows\
  \ of Madness</em> is one of the most versatile modules we've ever published. The\
  \ module consists of three adventures for first- or second-level characters, and\
  \ these adventures can be played as standalones, in any imaginable two-part arc,\
  \ or all together, like a traditional module-length adventure. The beginning of\
  \ the book includes detailed instructions for how to build a story that fits GMs'\
  \ needs and interests, as well as tips to make the story feel as immersive as possible.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Beyond this, all three adventures were written with GMs' ease in mind;\
  \ most of the content comes from the <a href=\"/products/btpy88yj\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Core Rulebook</em></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy8auu\"><em>Bestiary</em></a>,\
  \ so it's perfect for beginning GMs and GMs who are running these adventures on\
  \ the fly. That said, there are a few elements in the adventures that are brand\
  \ new, both from a story and a rules perspective, ensuring that even veteran players\
  \ and GMs will stay on their toes. Without providing too many spoilers in this direction,\
  \ let's just say that the module's title is both figurative and very literal.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Wholly aside from the module's format, there's another thing that has\
  \ us stoked; this module gives players and GMs the first detailed look at Saringallow.\
  \ This large town in Isger has a dark history involving diabolist Chelish nobles;\
  \ PCs who play these adventures will have nuanced conversations with the locals,\
  \ including Mayor Sandra Trinelli, that can shed light on this tragic past.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>The individual adventures take place either in Saringallow proper, in\
  \ the wilderness surrounding the settlement, or in the abandoned Sarini Estate,\
  \ but regardless, the PCs will have the chance to confront the settlement's past\
  \ while grappling with new threats that could spell a whole new type of doom in\
  \ the very near future.</p> \n    <p>To learn more, you'll have to pick up the book.\
  \ For now, I'll simply leave you with this gorgeous half-page illustration of the\
  \ old Sarini Estate.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderModules/PZO9552-Opener.jpg\"\
