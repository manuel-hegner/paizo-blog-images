  \   </table> \n   <p><i>The young nation of Andoran threw off the shackles of aristocracy\
  \ when its liege nation Cheliax adopted an official policy of diabolism after Aroden's\
  \ death, and has since established itself as the Inner Sea's largest democracy.\
  \ Though free from the tyrannical rule of Taldor and Cheliax, Andoran hopes to see\
  \ tyranny in all its forms wiped from the Inner Sea, and its allies strive ever\
  \ to increase their own presence in Absalom, which they see as the key to ending\
  \ slavery and oppression's hold on the weak and poor of Avistan and Garund. Through\
  \ the efforts of the Steel Falcon branch of Andoran's elite military Eagle Knights—\
  especially the work of the naval Gray Corsairs—the nation aspires to advance its\
  \ ideals abroad through diplomacy and battle.</i></p> \n   <p>Congratulations, Andoren\
  \ Pathfinders! Since the very beginning of Pathfinder Society Organized Play at\
  \ Gen Con 2008, your faction has been the clear frontrunner in terms of popularity,\
  \ and with a huge army come huge successes. Though the faction war isn't a zero-sum\
  \ game, we're happy to call Andoran the clear victor in the first three seasons\
  \ of Pathfinder Society play.</p> \n   <p>But, you're probably asking, if Andoran's\
  \ victory didn't bring about the collapse of Cheliax nor the abolition of slavery\
  \ throughout the Inner Sea, what was the point? As the first step in making character\
  \ choices matter and faction prestige count, we'll be introducing several changes\
  \ to the faction from an in-world perspective to reflect its increasing influence\
  \ in Absalom.</p> \n   <p>First, we've given the faction a new symbol, displayed\
  \ for the first time in this very blog post. While the symbol is changing, shirts\
  \ with the old faction will still earn players a free reroll per session. This symbol\
  \ will replace the clip-arty falcon currently displayed on the paizo.com messageboards\
  \ and Pathfinder Society membership cards.</p> \n   <p>Additionally, Captain Colson\
  \ Maldris, the highest-ranking Eagle Knight in Absalom and leader of the faction,\
  \ will be receiving a promotion for the successful forwarding of his organization's\
  \ goals—a promotion that should open up additional doors for him among Absalom's\
  \ complex upper classes and increase his chances of further cementing Andoran's\
  \ influence in the Inner Sea, that is, as long as his agents in the Pathfinder Society\
  \ continue to perform with such diligence and aplomb.</p> \n   <p>We'll also be\
  \ shifting the faction's alignment from neutral good to chaotic good, to emphasize\
  \ the less lawful tactics of sabotage, subterfuge, and incitement to revolt the\
  \ Eagle Knights often employ to see tyrannies topple and democracy thrive. For those\
  \ Andoren paladins out there, don't fear. With the advent of five new factions next\
  \ season, Andoran won't be the only obviously good-aligned faction. But if you don't\
  \ want to change factions and have been doing okay with most past missions, you\
  \ won't see a huge shift from the Andoren status quo when the faction's alignment\
  \ officially changes.</p> \n   <p>Tune in next Monday for a look at the newest addition\
  \ to the arsenals of both GMs and event coordinators, and a change to our open call\
  \ submission process to increase authors' chances of being published in official\
  \ Pathfinder Society sanctioned adventures.</p> \n   <p>Mark Moreland <br>Developer</p>\
