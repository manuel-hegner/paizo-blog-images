  \     </div> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Three years\
  \ ago, First Seeker Luwazi Elsebo fulfilled her mandate as head of the Starfinder\
  \ Society and announced her retirement. Four prominent Starfinders stepped forward\
  \ to vie for the mantle of First Seeker. Each candidate was based on the character\
  \ of real-world players, and they were featured in <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq021b9?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-207-Four-for-the-First\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #2-07: Four for the First</em></a>. Starfinder\
  \ Society players from around the world cast their votes and elected Ehu Hadif Ko’\
  ra Amares of Clan Tolar as our First Seeker.</p> \n      <p>Much like First Seeker\
  \ Luwazi Elsebo before him, First Seeker Ehu Hadif has announced his upcoming retirement.\
  \ With the culmination of the Year of Fortune’s Fall, Ehu will be stepping down\
  \ as First Seeker, and a new first seeker will take his place for the launch of\
  \ Season 7 of the Starfinder Society campaign. </p> \n      <p>This past fall, we\
  \ released a boon that allowed real-world players to submit their Starfinder Society\
  \ characters for consideration for First Seeker. Over a hundred experienced Starfinders\
  \ were submitted, and we’ve been hard at work narrowing these Starfinders down to\
  \ four. </p> \n      <p>At GenCon this August we’re releasing <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02eji?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-606-Tomorrows-Seekers\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #6-06: Tomorrow’s Seekers</em></a>, an adventure\
  \ for 1st- through 4th-level characters that introduces these four candidates. By\
  \ playing this scenario, you’ll have a chance to meet, question, and go on a mission\
  \ for each of these four potential First Seekers! When you’re done, swing by <strong><a\
  \ href=\"https://paizo.com/starfindersociety/firstseeker\">paizo.com/firstseeker</a></strong>\
  \ and vote for your preferred candidate to help shape the future of the Starfinder\
  \ Society!</p> \n      <p>Below are a few important notes about this scenario and\
  \ the First Seeker Election.</p> \n      <ul> \n       <li>Since so much of this\
  \ scenario involves the PCs getting to know specific candidates and the types of\
  \ missions to expect from them, this scenario eases the restrictions on run time.\
  \ If you want to play this scenario over an extended time slot or over two sessions\
  \ to make sure none of the interactions feel rushed, please do so.</li> \n     \
  \  <li>Because we want players to get to know the candidates and understand that\
  \ may take multiple play-throughs, <em>Tomorrow’s Seekers</em> will be a repeatable\
  \ scenario.</li> \n       <li>Though players may experience the scenario multiple\
  \ times, only one vote per player counts. The First Seeker election uses ranked\
  \ ballot voting.</li> \n       <li>In late June, our First Seeker Election 2023\
  \ landing page goes live! Once it’s live, you can visit <strong><a href=\"https://paizo.com/starfindersociety/firstseeker\"\
  >paizo.com/firstseeker</a></strong> for more information on how and when to vote,\
  \ the First Seeker candidates, and other assets, including an in-character information\
  \ flier on our candidates.</li> \n       <li>In July, visit the <strong>com</strong>\
  \ blog for a First Seeker Election roundtable! This in-character blog will give\
  \ you more details on all four of our candidates, including their personalities,\
  \ interests, and plans for the Starfinder Society.</li> \n       <li>Voting begins\
  \ in early August, alongside the release of <em>Tomorrow’s Seekers </em>at GenCon,\
  \ and closes October 31st, 2023. You can cast your vote at <strong><a href=\"https://paizo.com/starfindersociety/firstseeker\"\
  >paizo.com/firstseeker</a></strong>. This gives our community over two months to\
  \ play <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02eji?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-606-Tomorrows-Seekers\"\
  ><em>Starfinder Society Scenario #6-06: Tomorrow’s Seekers</em></a> and cast their\
  \ vote for First Seeker.</li> \n       <li>This scenario remains playable (and repeatable)\
  \ after the voting window closes, players just won’t get the opportunity to vote\
  \ for the new First Seeker.</li> \n       <li>Sometime in late 2023, we’ll reveal\
  \ the results of the vote, which will help to shape the direction of season seven\
  \ of the Starfinder Society, releasing in 2024.</li> \n      </ul> \n      <br>\
  \ \n      <p>And now, it’s my honor to present a short introduction to our four\
  \ candidates for First Seeker! For more information, check out <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02eji?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-606-Tomorrows-Seekers\"\
