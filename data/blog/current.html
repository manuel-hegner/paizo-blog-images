                   <h3>Basil Wright (he/they/xe)</h3>
                   <p>Basil Wright (he/they/xe) is a Black and Seminole Game Designer and Sensitivity Consultant located in Florida. When writing for Paizo, they wrote <em>The Aucturn Dilemma</em>, a Starfinder bounty. His work has also appeared in All the Witches, Backchannels (Backwater Games), and is forthcoming in Jukebox. Xe has provided sensitivity consulting for MCDM Productions, Brotherwise Games, and many others.&nbsp;</p>
                   <p>Currently, Basil is finishing Pelogos, their horror TTRPG about death, grief, and the afterlife. Players can either be an underwater paranormal investigator called a Lantern Keeper, or a sea ghost called an Echo, and can help the living come to terms with their loss. Once that project is complete, they'll be turning their attention to Rancher’s Respite: Call of Nature, an expansion to Rancher's Romance; both are a homage to their mother's expansive love of werewolf rancher romance novels. Their other long-term project is The Afrodyssey, where they intend to translate all 24 books of Homer's Odyssey into African American Vernacular English.</p>
                   <p>When xe's not working on games, Basil is either playing video games (visual novels, horror, etc.) or (lovingly) pestering xir sibling to make xem more banana jam for xir Monte Cristo sandwiches.</p>

                   <p>“Coming to the hobby fairly late, I was kicking myself for not taking up TTRPGs sooner. It's been a great source of new adventures and new friends. If you're even halfway curious but worried about what others may think, or about sticking out at the table, I promise you that if you find a good group and jump straight in, you won't regret it! More and more black folks are making their voices heard in the Tabletop RPG space, so lend us yours!"</p>

                   <h3>Quinn Murphy</h3>
                   <p>Quinn Murphy's journey with RPGs started when he "inherited" his brother's copy of Chainmail at the age of 11. He started running games for his friends and hasn't stopped for over thirty years. Though he's been building games his whole life, he started doing it professionally in 2009. Since then, he's written for a wide range of products and companies, including (but not limited to): Paizo (Pathfinder, Starfinder), Wizards of the Coast, Kobold Press, Magpie Games, and Onyx Path Publishing. Quinn loves TTRPGs of all shapes and sizes and relishes the thrill of finding the perfect form-factor to express a setting or idea. He believes that <a href="https://thoughtcrimegames.substack.com/?utm_source=navbar&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;r=7n2ha">Imagination is for Everyone</a>.</p>
                   <p>With his own&nbsp;company, Thoughtcrime Games, Quinn is currently running a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/communityradio/community-radio">Kickstarter for Community Radio</a>, a wacky improvisational TTRPG inspired by <em>Welcome to Nightvale</em>.</p>

                   <h3>Shan Wolf (he/they)</h3>
                   <p>Hi everyone, I am a freelance game designer and contributing author on both the Pathfinder and Starfinder Lines. My credits include <em>Starfinder Bounty #4: Poacher’s Prize</em>, the Adventure Toolbox for the first part of the Drift Hackers Adventure Path, <em>Starfinder Ports of Call</em>, the Adventure Toolbox for the second part of the Strength of Thousands Adventure Path, <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Highhelm</em>, as well as a few other projects.</p>
                   <p>My primary focus as a writer is in Black and Indigenous liberation narratives, monster creation, archetype creation, history and lore, and writing revolutionary and inherently anti-colonialist themes. Besides that, I am a huge Pathfinder and Starfinder booster. I love these games as they help bring to life amazing fantasies about being heroes and saving the world, or Universe, and that is always something I’m interested in doing, or just talking about in general.</p>
                   <p>If you’re interested in my work or hearing my views, feel free to take a look at my twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/Fenrirs_Chosen">@Fenrirs_Chosen</a>.You will see an outspoken and passionate advocate for Black liberation and making the tabletop space more open, safe, and inclusive.</p>

                   <p itemprop="description"><em>I begin my annotation holding death between my talons. An overly poetic beginning, that, and one I will certainly change when I report back to my Lady. Perhaps this a consequence of reading the Godsrain Prophecies, each with its dire tale of the death of a god and everything that comes after. I am reminded of the year I read</em> What Comes Down: A Treatise on Mortal Falls <em>and used the word defenestrate so often in my papers that Lorminos asked me to limit the word to once per page at most!</em></p>
                   <p><em>As my earlier field notes on these works detail, I learned of the Godsrain Prophecies not long ago, and have acted with great haste to locate as many as possible, despite my many doubts as to their accuracy. I must confess that I have also felt a certain unanticipated exhilaration in bringing rigor to a rumor, despite the grim contents of the documents once discovered. I believe that I may almost understand the impulse of adventurers (a mortal drive that remains an obscure field of study), though I likely took as much joy from detailing my methods as I did in undertaking them. Research rarely moves at such a rapid pace, but then rarely has any researcher been so motivated!</em></p>
                   <p><em>What to make of these “prophecies” is a wholly different matter, and one that I must settle before reporting to my Lady, lest I stir up visions of doom with no attempt at context or framing, no better than a doomsday caller singing in the streets! Any thought of these being accurate seems at first impossible, given the current failure of prophecy overall, and their author has yet to be identified. I immediately recall the many false omens in the years after Aroden’s death, many of which had Golarion perishing brutally a thousand times (and will one day, I assume, make for a fascinating set of studies).</em></p>
                   <p><em>Still, there is something about these pages that makes me ill at ease. The detail, perhaps, or the nature of the futures they forecast. This is heightened, of course, by the subject of the first of them, which I hoped never to find but must still document faithfully, as I have below. Perhaps the thing that troubles me lies in this simple question: how do you tell your Lady that she’s prophesied to die?</em></p>

                   <h2>The Death of Pharasma</h2>
                   <p>When Pharasma dies, she dies by inches. She grasps for a prophecy beyond her reach and the skin on her fingertips blisters. She dreams the lost feeling of futures foretold and wakes with a tooth ground to ashes. She feels an uncertainty chilling the air, and her bones grow cold and brittle. <em>What changed with Aroden’s death? Why has prophecy faltered?</em> The questions race and turn and tumble, edges carving at her mind as she tries to judge the mortal souls whose futures she’s unsure of.</p>
                   <p>Is it any wonder that she shatters?</p>
                   <p>The god they called Survivor dies alone inside her palace—cold, exhausted, broken. No psychopomps to judge her works, no Atropos to take her reign. Most of her servants lose their power in the instant she dies, and no one comes to place her in a plane for all eternity. The fear of how she might be judged has kept her upright more than once, but in the end it’s simply this—she is and then she isn’t. Pharasma ceases to be.</p>
                   <p>Death does not pause for the Lady of Graves. Death does not stop for anyone. Mortals succumb to the usual things—some in the arms of those who loved them, some at the hands of those who did not. Some in a show of bravery, some in a haze of regret, some drenched hot with sweat or fear or love or loss or anger. All plunge into the River of Souls like jagged rocks sent tumbling, leaving eddies in their wake that shift and roil the current. The river churns with energy, a swirling froth of rapids, throwing souls from in its midst with no set rhyme or reason. The guardians who watch it pass are nothing more than onlookers, as this soul bound for Heaven is shunted off to Abaddon, and that one at the brink of Hell is flung into Nirvana. With souls no longer guided to the places where they’re most aligned, the outer planes turn turbulent, splintering to factions where they once found harmony. Fights break out, and rescue missions; pacts and trades and promises no sooner made than torn apart—a muddied bloodied mess of souls askew for all eternity.</p>
                   <p>Pharasma’s former psychopomps, distracted by the chaos or the torrents of the river or the sorrow of their grief, rarely see the predators who feast within the river’s wake—daemons and worse who grab souls up by the handful, taking them to sell or gift or simply disappear with.</p>
                   <p>Among the mortals, resurrections now begin to falter, as souls are often missing from the places where they’re sought. Even for those who never cared a moment for Pharasmin things, the new finality of death leaves many saying prayers for Pharasma, desperate for a sign that she might one day still reach out.</p>
                   <p>Her followers are hardest hit—the clerics and diviners, the midwives and morticians—their boons no longer functioning, their spells bereft of power. Those who battle the undead see their advantage dissipate, and some who cannot fight or flee fall easily to undead foes, their victories turned to slaughters in a hundred grim tableaus.</p>
                   <p>Urgathoa laughs, heartily, to see a foe defeated, declaring 50 days of feasts and manifesting blood-soaked wine in any empty cup. She calls upon her followers to press their new advantages, as those who fought her worshippers are left to face a reckoning—some turning to another god whose purpose fits their calling, some searching for a prophecy or ritual or sacrifice that might bring back Pharasma and the surety she gave them, some finding other pledges for their cause.</p>
                   <p>Above it all, a visage hangs and grins upon the chaos—Groetus watching eagerly from just above the Spire. Some say the crescent of his moon begins to wax in earnest, as we move ever closer to the end times he desires.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 13px;">A prophecy foretelling the death of Pharasma specifically caused by the death of prophecy in the Age of Lost Omens certainly poses a paradox.</p>

                   </center>
                   <p><em>An unpleasant future, to say the least. I shudder to think of it! Thankfully, much of this prophecy remains questionable at best. Not only are there are many questions raised here, including the likeliness of my fellow psychopomps to simply cease their work and let souls be ravaged, whatever their grief, but this also appears to note the cause of my Lady’s death as indirectly caused by the end of prophecy. And yet if there is no prophecy, then how has this one come to be? A paradox, if I ever knew one, and one that I cannot yet untangle. Perhaps my next annotation will offer greater clarity.</em></p>

                   <p>Hey everyone! I’m Michelle, a developer on Pathfinder’s Narrative team. I started off as a freelance writer for Paizo so you’ll see my name pop up in projects like&nbsp;<em>Season of Ghosts, Howl of the Wild,&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Lost Omens Divine Mysteries&nbsp;</em>as well as some other unannounced products down the pipeline. I’m a big fan of horror ttrpgs like&nbsp;<em>Call of Cthulhu</em>,&nbsp;<em>Ten Candles</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Bluebeard’s Bride</em>&nbsp;but also a huge sucker for mecha games like&nbsp;<em>Spectres of Brocken.&nbsp;</em>I’ll play almost anything; crunchy? Yes. Narrative? Also yes.I have a few personal projects in the works including a Joseon setting supplement for&nbsp;<em>Good Society: A Jane Austen RPG</em>. If you want to find me on socials, I’m on Twitter at @_missmyk_ and on Bluesky at @missmyk.bsky.social.</p>

                   <p>Hello! I’m Lynne (she/they), a queer, autistic, chronically ill femme originally from Chicago. Since joining the editing team last June, I’ve been living my best Leslie Knope life in Indiana and working on incredible stuff I can’t wait for you all to see.</p>
                   <p>Named a 2021 Queer in Games Awardee by Rainbow Game Jam, I’m best known for my work on the ENNIE Award-winning Uncaged: Goddesses and Uncaged Anthology. In my free time these days, I’m usually doing one of three things: playing the Chief Medical Officer in my Star Trek Adventures home game; doting on Izzy, my ancient, beloved kitty; or drinking way too much coffee as I wrap writing for the upcoming All the Witches TTRPG. I’m an unapologetic dice goblin, an em dash enthusiast, and an octopus stan who thinks that the Dumbo Octopus is the cutest thing ever. Come say hello on Bluesky (@lynnemeyer.bsky.social) and Twitter (@Lynne_M_Meyer).</p>

                   <p>Who, me? I guess you could say that I’m one of those “returning faces,” having come back to Paizo last year to take a position as a Senior Developer on the Pathfinder Rules &amp; Lore Team! In my career at Paizo, I’ve been an editor, a developer of Starfinder Adventure Paths, and more! I’m thrilled to be working with second edition and with the rest of this team, who are an honest-to-goodness bunch of rock stars. You can find me at herzwesten on a lot of the social medias and if you want to see the type of things I get up to in my spare time, check out This Compleat Breakfast (a game about cereal mascots) on my <a href="https://herzwesten.itch.io/this-compleat-breakfast">itch.io page</a>!</p>

                   <h3>Felix Dritz (he/him)</h3>
                   <p>Greetings fellow finders of the paths and stars! I’m Felix, one of the editors who sift through the many words you read. This means I check for general errors, discrepancies, formatting, and ensure it has that recognizable Paizo style.</p>
                   <p>I was first introduced to Pathfinder Organized Play in 2016 by accident, and I never left. So many kind and supportive people adopted me into this community, and I’m overjoyed that I get to support the games they love. It’s been a surreal journey to get here, but now I’m at a desk editing for a game I adore and the community I love.</p>
                   <p>When not editing for Paizo, I’m usually homebrewing my ever-expanding Pathfinder 2nd Edition setting. If I’m not editing or writing, then I’m likely playing Pathfinder, GMing at local game stores, mashing buttons on a videogame controller, or cooking. I’m not active on social media, but I hope to meet you around the table someday!</p>

                   <p>Hello! I’m Mike Kimmel, and I’m thrilled to be the newest member of the Starfinder team. Since coming on board in September 2023, I’ve been hard at work with my colleagues to create Starfinder Second Edition. While my prior work as a developer for Pathfinder Society Organized Play mostly involved adventure design, I’ve been able to stretch my narrative and game design muscles on the Starfinder team in all sorts of interesting ways these past few months. Alas, I can’t talk much about the things I’m working on—yet—but stay tuned for more Starfinder news in the coming weeks! I can’t wait for you to see what we’ve got in store for you.</p>
                   <p>Aside from working on games, I like to play them, too! I’m a fan of cooperative games of all kinds, and I also enjoy relaxing with a nice cup of tea and a challenging permadeath videogame. When I get a chance to run an RPG campaign, I tend to lean into horror themes—the spookier the better. If you’d like to chat about games, recommend a good book to me, or play some chess, you can find me on various Paizo-related Discord channels or drop me a line at <a href="mailto:mike.kimmel@paizo.com">mike.kimmel@paizo.com</a>. Please note that I am not accepting glitch gremlins or other mischief at this time!</p>

                   <h3>Simone D. Sallé (she/they)</h3>
                   <p>Hi again! I’ve been in the Paizo orbit as a temp, freelance, and full-time contracted editor since 2018. I joined the staff as a senior editor in 2022 and have been having a wonderful time wrangling words with the creative team ever since! While we’ve worked on a lot of great projects lately, I’m particularly excited for everyone to see &lt;em&gt;<em>Pathfinder Howl of the Wild</em>&lt;/em&gt; in May, which has some extremely fun new ancestries and mechanics, incredible art, and a heartfelt story.</p>
                   <p>Unsurprisingly, words and games fill a lot of my time outside of work as well: I have a spreadsheet of SFF book recs for anyone who asks, a handful of Pathfinder and indie TTRPG campaigns on my calendar, and an overflowing queue of Steam games that I frequently ignore to revisit Subnautica (my beloved). I also do freelance editorial work as Wildwood Editing for projects like Queerfinder and Luminant Age. I’m grateful to my Disreputable Dog, Penny Kibeth, for reminding me to take a break from screens and get some fresh air every day.</p>
                   <p>Editors largely operate behind the scenes, and our best work is invisible, but I can confidently say that I work with some of the finest professionals in the industry, and it’s a delight to learn, grow, and help shape the games I love with them and everyone else at Paizo. I’m not as active on social media these days, but if you track me down I’m always thrilled to discuss conscious language in storytelling, the merits of style guides, and how we can make our worlds—both real and imagined—better for everyone.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h3>Dustin Knight</h3>
                   <p>Greetings, Starfinders! I’ve had the honor of being a member of the Starfinder team for a little over a year and working here at Paizo is still a dream come true! I’m currently moving into my dream home in St. Paul, Minnesota, running a Firefighters of Absalom campaign, <em>Where There’s Smoke</em>, and playing in an incredible Starfinder campaign, <em>Teenaged Wasteland</em>. I’ve been a freelance author and publisher on Pathfinder Infinite for the past few years, as well as avid tabletop gamer, and Paizo-sphere discord lurker! I’m honored to help manage the rules of one of my favorite games in one of its most exciting eras and you may have seen me drop the FAQs and Errata updates for the Starfinder Roleplaying Game. I’m also thrilled to see everyone’s excitement and enthusiasm for Starfinder Second Edition, as working on a new Core Rulebook line with such an incredible team has been my developer hoop dream for decades. Feel free to hit me up using any of the various Paizo discords, including my own discord channel for Pathfinder &amp; Starfinder Infinite fans and authors at http://www.infiknight.net, or email me at <a href="mailto:dustin.knight@paizo.com">dustin.knight@paizo.com</a>!

                   </div>
                   <br>
                   <p><b>Bringing The Flavor</b><br>
                     What makes a good meal good? This is the direction from which you should approach any TTRPG writing. After all, it’s not far from the truth! You’re serving up a meal for people, and you have two goals to make sure it pleases your clientele.</p>
                   <p>First off, you have to make sure the meal doesn’t poison them and kill them. Dead clients will not buy your food again, nor will they try your homebrew, third-party publisher (3pp) work, or original writing! In our cooking metaphor, this is the role of mechanics; it’s what provides your meal/TTRPG writing with a healthy structure and makes it “good for you.” It is, fundamentally, the most important part of what you’re making. Without good balance, your feat, item, spell, or whatever it is that you’re making will fall apart. People will look at what it grants, say “this seems busted,” and make a snap judgment on whether the rest of the project is worth checking out. But is a passable structure enough?</p>
                   <p>Absolutely not. Adding something extra transforms a merely digestible offering into one that’s delicious. And that something extra in both the world of food and writing is flavor.</p>
                   <p>Flavor text is a crucial ingredient that often goes uncelebrated, but it makes the difference between incredible and bland. But to make the flavor pop, you need to know—what do people like? In this context, I’m going to speak from my personal experience. I write books for the Classes+ series, a line of 3pp books that focuses on expanding existing classes, like <a href="https://www.pathfinderinfinite.com/product/397932/Witches?src=also_purchased&amp;filters=100112">witches</a>, <a href="https://www.pathfinderinfinite.com/product/415864/Clerics?src=by_author_of_product&amp;filters=100112">clerics</a>, <a href="https://www.pathfinderinfinite.com/product/444888/Magus?src=by_author_of_product&amp;filters=100112">magi</a>, etc. I’ll talk about things I’ve found that have helped me write flavor text that keeps people coming back, and how to give them a go yourself.</p>
                   <p>First off, you want your flavor to be consistent. This goes for any piece of text, of course, but it’s one that’s often overlooked in fantasy TTRPGs. You want your content to fit into the world within which it’ll exist or most likely be used. For Pathfinder, a lot of people are either going to be playing in Golarion or in a homebrew world most likely based in fantasy tropes. That’s just the kind of setting that Pathfinder most easily lends itself to; the sword and sorcery aspects are the biggest selling point. So, when writing a new option, you want it to be something that can seamlessly fit into this world without breaking its established rules. For example, when writing <a href="https://www.pathfinderinfinite.com/product/450292/Archetypes?src=hottest_filtered&amp;filters=100112">Archetypes+</a>, we wanted to create something that would expand existing options and add new ones too. One of the new archetypes we decided to make was a clown. This was difficult, because most people have one of two very specific ideas when it comes to clowns: a red-nosed guy in a funny wig, or a murderous slasher with smeared white makeup. While there are places where these could feasibly fit in Golarion, they don’t fit everywhere. Indeed, a standard party with a fighter, wizard, cleric, and then a classic clown might not look right. It’s noticeably “other,” and it had the potential to make people turn up their noses at the product and not include it in their game. So how did we lessen the otherness of it?</p>
                   <p>That’s where our next point comes into play. Research! This may come as a surprise, but you are not an infinite sponge of all knowledge ever. You need to look up what you’re writing on, give yourself a brief lesson on the topic, and then return to it. So, continuing with clowns: how did we make clowns fit? Pathfinder’s setting ranges from prehistoric times (with the Mammoth Kings) to 1800s-analogous Absalom. As it turns out, clowns have a long history between prehistoric times and the late 1800s! The first clowns were priest-clowns in Ancient Egypt, over 4,000 years ago. Then, throughout the medieval era, there were jesters, who acted as advisors to nobility. In the 16th century, <em>commedia dell'arte</em> was popularized in Italy. These theatrical sketch shows involved masked character archetypes like the daring Harlequin and the glum Pierrot. Finally, in the early 1800s, Joseph Grimaldi introduced face paint, colorful costumes, and all the tropes we associate with the common clown. Once we knew that clowns did exist during the timeframe that Pathfinder likes to play with, we could make something fitting for it! But now, the next question is… how did we make it unique?</p>
                   <p>One’s work needs to stand out on its own. Yes, the mechanics might be unique, but the dressing over the mechanics needs to be something unlike anything else the game has to offer presently… while, crucially, feeling exactly like something else the game has to offer. It’s extraordinarily easy to go overboard here and quickly go from “Here’s a fun idea” to “What if the clown can use three actions to become a clown elemental?” Mechanically, maybe that’s fine, but it’s a strange idea that breaks the existing lore of the world. The implication of an elemental plane of clown, while itself horrifying, also completely ignores the Golarion setting’s rules and, most likely, the rules of any other setting missing an elemental clown plane.</p>
                   <p>But then, what if you don’t go far enough? Perhaps clowns can pull tricks to inspire their allies in combat! But… that’s just the bard, another entertainment-focused character option. If you don’t go far enough, your writing will feel unsure of itself. You really need to solidly hit that middle ground. What’s something that’s <em>like</em> existing content, but not so similar as to lack identity, and not so different as to become nonsensical in most settings?</p>
                   <p>Clowns are meant to be ridiculous, so some of our ideas were naturally going to be a little more comedically toned, but we wanted them to fit most worlds. The feat Rubber Body is a good example of our process—it’s a feat that plays with the raw physicality of clownish performances, which often include over-the-top slapstick. The feat gives the clown resistance to damage as a reaction while also knocking them back 15 feet and rendering them prone. Another feat, Uncanny Legerdemain, allows clowns to seemingly magically transport items from one closed hand to another, or one sleeve to another. This feat not only allows a character to pull off classic magic tricks, it also offers good roleplay opportunities like smuggling, stealing, and otherwise storing items in an extradimensional space in a comical fashion. All of these fit the clown without being too out there, and without feeling exactly like anything presently in the game.</p>
                   <p>So, that’s what it comes down to. It seems like a daunting task—have the idea, make sure it fits into the world you’re writing for, research it, and then make sure it isn’t too much or too little. It’s not easy to pull off, but you need to be sure to put in the appropriate work here. It doesn’t matter if you have the greatest mechanics in the world—dry oats may be healthy, but they don’t taste great. Thankfully, once you get used to writing flavor, it starts getting easier. It’s like standing in front of an oven and smelling the aroma of the food waft up to you; you’ll feel like there’s no stopping you, and pretty soon, you’ll have made something people won’t forget!</p>
                   <p>Derry Luttrell (they/he) is an animator, illustrator, and writer from Kildare, Ireland. They are the host of <a href="https://www.dicewillroll.com/"><em>Dice Will Roll</em></a>, an award-winning Pathfinder Second Edition podcast which has recently passed 400,000 downloads and started its 1970s-inspired run of Abomination Vaults, complete with synth music, VHS sounds, and classic dungeon crawling fun. It was while running <em>Dice Will Roll</em> that Derry decided to make a book of homebrew witch patrons. This eventually bloomed into Witches+, brought to life by an impromptu teamup between Derry and Tony Saunders. Thousands of sales later, Team+ is the most successful duo on Pathfinder Infinite—the first of their brand-new products to reach the mithral and platinum ranks. In Team+ projects, Derry largely tackles flavor and illustration. Their heavily stylized art decorates each release, inside and out. Derry is open for commissions; find them on Discord as @derryzumi.</p>
                   <p>In the next few months, Derry will be launching <em>Safe Haven: A Weird West Tale</em>, a 200-page book for Pathfinder Second Edition and D&amp;D 5e, with a western-themed adventure that goes from Level 5 to Level 10 and features a setting splatbook for a world where magic has died and the age of the gunslinger is upon us.</p>

                   </div>
                   <br>
                   <p>The first product we’ve announced is the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ez4?Starfinder-Second-Edition-Playtest-Rulebook"><em>Starfinder Playtest Rulebook</em></a>. This 264-page softcover playtest book contains a figurative ton of new Starfinder content using the Pathfinder Second Edition rules as a foundation. You’ll notice right away that this book requires the use of <em>Pathfinder Player Core</em> and <em>Pathfinder GM Core</em>. The reason for this is because we wanted to provide as much new content as possible without reprinting massive sections of rules that already exist in Pathfinder rulebooks and on our online PRD at Archives of Nethys. All relevant rules will be reprinted in full for our 2025 release.</p>
                   <p>Inside this rulebook, you’ll find six classes (including the Envoy, Mystic, Operative, Solarian, Soldier, and Witchwarper)*, new ancestries, new feats, new spells, a new equipment system, and more! The idea is to provide as many tools as possible for a Starfinder game, along with some of the new systems and tweaks necessary for running a science-fantasy game. When 2025 rolls around, we’ll be splitting this content (and more) into appropriate player- and GM-facing books. Please note, the <em>Starfinder Playtest Rulebook</em> will not have any special edition covers or hardback editions and is intended to be released as a softcover book. The PDF for this product will be made freely available at launch.</p>
                   <p>While many of you have heard about the playtest rulebook already, you probably haven’t heard about our playtest modules and the associated flip-mat. So, let’s talk about those!</p>
                   <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ez5?Starfinder-Second-Edition-Playtest-Adventure-A-Cosmic-Birthday"><em>Starfinder Second Edition Playtest Adventure: A Cosmic Birthday</em></a>, written by Paizo senior developer Jenny Jarzabski, is the first of two playtest adventures that we’ll be releasing during the playtest window. This adventure takes place on Absalom Station and is meant to introduce new 1st-level characters to the setting of Starfinder. You’ll explore the station as a setting-shattering event occurs: the hatching of the planet Aucturn and the emergence of a new deity into the Starfinder core pantheon! We’ll have SO much more to share about this in the coming months!**</p>

                   <br>
                   <p>Our similarly announced <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ez3?Starfinder-FlipMat-Second-Edition-Playtest-MultiPack"><em>Starfinder Flip-Mat: Second Edition Playtest Multi-Pack</em></a> also has a bit of a spoiler which we’ll talk BRIEFLY about…</p>
                   <p><em>Starfinder Second Edition Playtest Adventure: Empires Devoured</em> (product page coming soon!) is our second and final playtest adventure. Written by Thurston Hillman (that’s me!), this 10th-level adventure takes place on the distant world of Kehtaria during the signing of a historic peace accord between two galactic superpowers…let’s just say that things don’t go entirely as planned.</p>
                   <p>We’ve written each playtest adventure to be like the adventures you’ve come to love from Paizo. These won’t involve slogging out wave-based encounters to stress test combat, but instead, they’ll have narratives and encounters that showcase how we can use the new Second Edition rules to create evocative stories in the Starfinder setting. These include all-new art and major setting events, and it’s our hope that these adventures remain relevant long after our playtest is over and we’re well into the new edition—after all, we need to know where your character was when Aucturn hatched!</p>
                   <p>Again, we’ll have SO much more to explain in the coming months about all these products. For now, enjoy a quick art preview of what to expect in <em>Empires Devoured</em>…</p>

                   <br>
                   <p>The conspirator dragon is one of the new occult dragons featured in <em>Monster Core</em>. Occult dragons tap into more mysterious and strange magic, making use of supernatural abilities that sometimes seem alien or off-putting. Most occult dragons have slender bodies. They use their wings as supplementary appendages, somewhat like front legs to keep their proper forward limbs for grasping and other uses.</p>
                   <p>The conspirator dragon is named such due to their innate desire to see grand plans play out. Conspirator dragons are constantly scheming, either for personal gain or simply because watching a plan come together is exciting. These schemes vary, with some dragons looking toward more benevolent goals, some enacting wicked plans, and others simply scheming for scheming’s sake. Regardless of their goals, conspirator dragons tend to manipulate others, pulling strings from the shadows to get what they want.</p>
                   <p>A conspirator dragon has a variety of abilities to help them achieve their goals. In addition to using their magic to charm and influence others, these dragons make use of magical disguises. They conjure forth flesh-suit replicas of others and, through the help of magic, squeeze themselves into these suits. This bone-crunching and flesh rending process results in perfect disguises that allow a conspirator dragon to live among populations none the wiser to the dragon’s machinations. If they’re ever found out, the dragon can erupt from the suit in an explosive display that hopefully buys them enough time to flee. If not, they also use their choking breath to create a literal smokescreen for escape.</p>
                   <p>And that’s our look at the conspirator dragon! Make sure to keep an eye out for this dragon and lots of other new dragons when <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ej4?Pathfinder-Monster-Core"><em>Monster Core</em></a> releases in March. Stay tuned for more draconic previews in the coming weeks. Next time, we’ll take a look at greatest treasure hoarders of all, the fortune dragons. See you then!</p>

                   <br>
                   <p>The Year of Era’s End is a time to celebrate the end of Starfinder First Edition! It’s a time to revisit old friends, capstone some of our most beloved ongoing storylines, and shine a spotlight on big, exciting events in the Starfinder setting—events that will change the course of the Pact Worlds now and have lasting effects into the future of Starfinder Second Edition!</p>
                   <p>So, whether you’re a veteran of the Starfinder Society, a newcomer who’s excited to get in on the game, or a fan looking to experience events that directly influence the upcoming Starfinder Second Edition, join us for the Year of Era’s End!</p>
                   <p>We're going out with a bang!</p>
                   <div class="blurbCenter">

                   <br>
                   <p>While much of the Year of Era’s End is focused on closure and big, exciting capstone events—events best suited for mid- to high-level play—our metaplot is focused on low-level play, to accommodate everyone who wants to get in on the game! But low level, however, doesn’t mean low impact!</p>
                   <p>Under the watchful eye of newly elected First Seeker Sarmak, the Starfinder Society travels to the machine planet of Aballon to undertake an archaeological survey of the ancient city of Eternity—a fabled city of the First Ones! During this three-adventure metaplot, the Starfinders explore mysterious ruins, discover long-forgotten secrets about the First Ones, and clash with a violent faction of anacite extremists named Those Who Call.</p>
                   <p>The Year of Era’s End begins with <em>Starfinder Society Intro: Year of Era’s End</em>, an adventure for 1st- through 4th-level characters written by Letterio Mammoliti! This adventure debuts at PaizoCon 2024 alongside one other Starfinder Society Scenario written by our very own Jenny Jarzabski, though we’re keeping that one under wraps for now!</p>
                   <p>With the launch of Year of Era’s End, the following ancestries will become “always available” for Organized Play: barathu, borai, ghibrani, morlamaw, orc, and prismeni. In addition, be on the lookout for a few new Starfinder Society boons related to the end of the Year of Fortune’s Fall and the launch of the Year of Era’s End, which you’ll be able to purchase online using your Achievement Points!</p>

                   <p>It’s going to be a year to remember.</p>

                   <h3>Convention Recruitment</h3>
                   <p>2024 is going to be an incredibly exciting year for Paizo. Be part of the excitement by volunteering as an Organized Play GM at our Premier Conventions! Our volunteer GMs are the best of the best, the cream of the crop, and the most helpful skittermanders in the galaxy. Last year, our volunteers ran over 1,000 games online and in person, and we’re looking to exceed that in 2024!</p>
                   <p>We are currently seeking volunteers for our two Premier Plus conventions: <strong>PaizoCon Online</strong> and <strong>Gen Con Indianapolis</strong>. Our friends in Columbus are also recruiting GMs for <strong>Origins</strong>, which I’m thrilled to announce I’ll be returning to this year!</p>
                   <p>You can get all the information in <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sihg"><strong>this blog post.</strong></a> Spots are going fast, so don’t delay, apply today!</p>
                   <h3>PaizoCon @ Your FLGS</h3>
                   <p>We’ve also announced the locations for this year’s pilot PaizoCon @ program! Nine game stores, as well as KublaCon in California, will be hosting PaizoCon events concurrent with the online show. Check out <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sih9?PaizoCon-Your-Local-Game-Store"><strong>this blog post</strong></a> for the locations, an interactive map and more!</p>
                   <h3>Interactive Special Presentation Survey</h3>
                   <p>As we start to build out the presentations for our interactive specials, we wanted to take the community’s temperature on how they’re working and what improvements can be made. If you’ve played in any of our multi-table specials over the past few years, and especially if you’ve been a House GM, we’d love to hear your thoughts in <a href="https://forms.gle/LKevtTrXHX4HCW8d8"><strong>this brief survey</strong></a>!</p>

                   <h2>2024 GM Boons</h2>
                   <p>With the recent influx of new players, Paizo Organized Play’s biggest problem is that we simply don’t have enough GMs to run games all the time. We’re always looking for ways to incentivize people into the GM chair, and we’ve got a new one this year!</p>
                   <p>Below are download links for two brand-new boons. These boons will unlock character options as you GM games. While you can run games with your friends and complete the boons that way, they will unlock faster if you GM at RSP-supported locations like your local game store, or at conventions (like, perhaps…Gen Con or PaizoCon).</p>
                   <p>We hope that those of you who have yet to take the plunge into GMing find this a great incentive to start, and that our long-time GMs are able to enjoy the fruits of their labor. Make sure to tell your friends about the rewards of GMing games for Organized Play!</p>
                   <center>
                    <p>Download the boons here:</p>

                   <h2>Sanctioning Updates</h2>
                   <h3>New Content</h3>
                   <p>New year, new sanctioning! We’re pleased to announce that sanctioning for our latest two adventure paths has been posted: Season of Ghosts for Pathfinder, and Scoured Stars for Starfinder. Long-time players may notice that the chronicle sheets for the Scoured Stars AP look familiar; in most cases, we took the original scenario chronicles and updated them based on the new content. We’ve also posted boons and sanctioning for the two Dynamite comics: <em>Pathfinder: Wake the Dead</em> and <em>Starfinder: Angels of the Drift</em>.</p>
                   <h3>Updates</h3>
                   <p>We’ve also made a couple of updates to the Character Options pages based on the Remaster and new errata.</p>
                   <p>For Pathfinder Society, we clarified that legacy bards can still use the Remastered feats in <em>Player Core</em> with both<em>inspire courage</em> and <em>courageous anthem</em>, to clear up that final bit of confusion. We also added a clarification to the Curse Maelstrom archetype for those who have unlocked it via the GM boons. Finally, it was brought to our attention that a number of 5th-level [Ancestry] Weapon Innovator feats have been included in the 1st-level [Ancestry] Weapon Familiarity feats in <em>Player Core</em>. Any character who has been affected by this may freely retrain their 5th-level ancestry feat out of the Weapon Innovator feat into something else!</p>
                   <p>On the Starfinder Society side, the recent Starfinder errata allowed us to make a couple of changes. The chlorophyll infusion serum from <em>Starfinder</em><em>Ports of Call </em>and the Forced Deconstruction mechanic trick from <em>Starfinder Enhanced</em>are now permitted for use with the design team’s changes.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>GM Recognition</h2>
                   <h3>Campaign Service Coins</h3>
                   <p>This month, a new Campaign Service Coins was awarded! We award these coins to members of the community who have gone above and beyond to provide an exceptional program to the community at large. Campaign Coins are awarded based on nominations; if you believe someone in your community is deserving of this award (whether or not they are a Venture Officer), send an email to organizedplay[at]paizo[dot]com with their name and reasons.</p>
                   <p>Congratulations to:</p>
                   <p><strong>Marc Daoust</strong>, who now holds a campaign coin and OP ID #874</p>
                   <h3>GM Ranks</h3>
                   <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p>
                   <p>This month, we had two GMs earn their 5th rank!</p>
                   <p><strong>5th Glyph (PFS2)</strong>: Federico Grecuccio (who is the first GM I’m aware of to do their three evaluation games in three different languages)</p>
                   <p><strong>5th Nova (SFS1)</strong>: Jake Rennels</p>
                   <p>That’s all from me this month, folks! Until next time—Explore! Report! Cooperate! And stick around for a big announcement later today!</p>

                     2 to 4 players take turns to draft and play colorful (and colorblind-friendly) hexagonal tiles to match specific patterns and meet their own secret objective. With several dozen pattern cards, variable objectives, and a game state that's constantly in flux, you'll never play the same way twice. Simple setup, easy-to-learn rules, and a short play time of around 30 minutes means there's always time for one more game…</p>

                   <h2>What is Infinite?</h2>
                   <p>Pathfinder and Starfinder Infinite is a program that allows you to create content (adventures and locations; monsters; character classes, archetypes, and backgrounds; fiction; etc.) based on Paizo’s intellectual property (IP), including Pathfinder’s Lost Omens campaign setting, and to make some money while you’re at it. Your work might even be recognized by the community and earn you an invitation into the Infinite Masters elite creator program.</p>

                   <p>Titles are ranked by an average of units sold and revenue earned and presented in alphabetical order. Asterisks indicate titles that have been on a best-seller list previously. Because they’ve consistently topped the list, and due to the number of their titles that typically take up spots, “Team+” and “Team Index” have asked to be removed from the calculations for ongoing top performers lists. This will allow newer publishers or book series to get more attention. Thanks, all!</p>

                   <p>The <em>Monstercology Galatica</em> is an attempt to catalog and describe all of the many and varied creatures that we share the galaxy with. We understand that with millions of stars and billions of worlds—plus those that visit the galaxy from other planes—this is a nearly impossible endeavor. But if we do not try it, then we can never succeed. This is but one small excerpt of the greater <em>Monstercology Galatica</em>, focusing on creatures most often seen during the later parts of the year.</p>

                   <p>A certain type of adventurer resides in the vast frontiers of space—wayfarers and drifters, hunters whose next meal rides on their cunning, their aim, and the price on their bounty's head. They carve out their existence beyond the fringes of civilization; the easy life is as alien to them as another man's gun, and just as fickle. They prefer the unpredictable and uncharted, far from prying eyes and folks what ask too many questions. Never tied to one place, these vagabonds stay strange and savvy, doing what they can to keep alive. When the galaxy needs a job done, they call for the rough and tumble space cowboy.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h3><a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/377149/Starfinder-Infinite-Mech-Threat-Manual?affiliate_id=2791261">Starfinder Infinite: Mech Threat Manual</a>*</h3>

Inside, you’ll find a spread of the latest mech creations of the Outer Sphere, deadly carnivorous mechform mimics, oozes that can slip inside a mech to throttle the operator or take over the machine entirely, and more. This book provides a variety of themed threats for use in mech combat at all levels of play, and all mechs within were made in accordance with the recommended alternative rules for creating NPC mechs from&nbsp;<em>Starfinder Tech Revolution</em>.&nbsp;</p>

                   <p>We’ve also got another Starfinder Bounty for all of you</p>
                   <p>Aucturn isn’t usually a great place to set up shop, but some corporations see the complete lack of regulations as a plus. When things go wrong, though, it’s up to “independent contractors” to deal with the issues. That’s you. Things have gone wrong, and Agent Bright, a representative of the Clearbright Institute of Discovery, a corporate conglomerate shrouded in mystery, contacts the PCs with an offer. It’ll be up to you to see if various deeds done on Aucturn ever see the light of day. This will likely be the first time on Aucturn for most of you, but I wouldn’t recommend taking in the sights.</p>

                   <p>Hello, Pathfinders and welcome to the new year!</p>
                   <p>This month is a double feature of scenarios, so buckle up!</p>
                   <p>First, the Pathfinder Society is paying Valashinaz a favor by traveling to an old temple that used to be a place of worship for her, but has since been abandoned after a terrible tempest! The Pathfinders will need to travel to her temple and collect the large collection of skymetals that were left as offerings long ago, while making sure that they don’t anger the spirits that still linger on the island. The Pathfinders have been warned that there may be akatas on the island, but since there aren’t any inhabitants, they should all be hibernating, right?</p>
                   <p>...right?</p>

                   <p>During those misadventures, the Pathfinder Society will also be sending a group of junior agents to attend and poke around a high-society auction in Niswan, in the hopes of collecting more information about the mysterious Benefactor that appeared at the end of the last year. It should be a night of elbow-rubbing, delicious pink chai, and gawking at fancy baubles; however, it wouldn’t be a party with Pathfinders if nothing went wrong! It seems that the auction may be attended by some partygoers that have no plans to pay for their treasures!</p>

                   <br>
                   <h2>Design Goals</h2>
                   <p>Overall, monsters were working well statistically and thematically, so there weren’t any changes to the basics of how monsters work. Instead, we focused on making the book gorgeous, expansive, and full of great monsters! We had several big goals for <em>Monster Core</em>.</p>
                   <p><strong>Match the Remaster Rules:</strong> We adjusted monster rules that needed to match new terminology or rules. For instance, changing “negative healing” to “void healing,” using “Reactive Strike,” and swapping out spells that were in <em>Core Rulebook</em>, but not <em>Player Core</em>.</p>
                   <p><strong>Collect the Greatest Hits:</strong> The most classic monsters mingle with new creations! This book is focused on creatures that you can use over and over in all sorts of games. Most creatures came over from the first <em>Bestiary</em>, with some updates. But we also graduated some monsters that appeared in <em>Bestiary 2</em> and <em>Bestiary 3</em> to the main monster book, including serpentfolk, herexens, marsh and shadow giants, phantoms, scarecrows, and more! Monster Core also brings several Pathfinder First Edition monsters into Second Edition, including bogwids and the sargassum heap (formerly sargassum fiend).</p>
                   <p><strong>Replace Some OGL Monsters:</strong> We cut several creatures that we were using from the OGL as we move to the ORC license and a set of creatures more specific to Pathfinder and Golarion. Where possible, we put in creatures that fill a similar role in adventure-building. For example, the sargassum heap mentioned above replaces another lurking 6th-level plant creature! We’ve also created exciting new devils, dragons, and other new threats in classic categories.</p>
                   <p><strong>Match the Mythology:</strong> For a great many creatures that originated in folklore, their abilities and look were based on sources like pulp novels and TV shows. Eleanor Ferron spearheaded an effort to take creatures like rakshasa, oni, dragon turtles, and coatls closer to their source material. Making them more authentic while ensuring they still match Golarion’s lore was a massive undertaking!</p>
                   <p><strong>Pack it Full!:</strong> Lastly, we wanted to include as many monsters as we could reasonably fit. Variety makes for memorable campaigns, adventures, and encounters, so getting more monsters in the book was great. The book is longer than the first <em>Bestiary,</em> but beyond that, we fit more stat blocks into several sections—dinosaurs have the same number of pages, but 10 creatures instead of seven.</p>
                   <p>There were also some changes that weren’t primary goals. Low-level monsters had high AC too often, and Michael Sayre did a pass to make the low-level experience more even. There wasn’t a level –1 plant or fungus for <em>summon plant or fungus</em>, so Landon Winkler made the sprigjack, a weaker twigjack.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>Wrap Battle</h2>
                   <p>On streams and other previews, we’ve talked quite a bit about hags, devils, and other monsters that had pretty big revisions. Let’s take a moment to go over an example of a smaller change. Mummies, beyond being classic horror monsters, make for great undead to include in musty tombs and dungeons. But the <em>Bestiary</em> version was primarily based on causing despair and imposing a rotting curse. They can be pretty static, so we were looking for something new to put into our basic mummies to make them more interesting, much like we reassessed them when creating new mummies for <em>Book of the Dead</em>.</p>
                   <p>Since the mummy guardian and mummy pharaoh were originally created with sophisticated chemical processes, we landed on an alchemical theme. You can see the special actions the mummy guardian can now use in combat, and how they reinforce the creature’s theme in a unique way!</p>

                   <h3>Mummy Guardian — Creature 6</h3>
                   <p>Medium, Mummy, Undead, Unholy<br><strong>Perception</strong> +16; darkvision<br><strong>Languages</strong> Necril, plus any one language they knew while alive<br><strong>Skills</strong> Athletics +15, Stealth +11<br><strong>Str</strong> +4, <strong>Dex</strong> +0, <strong>Con</strong> +2, <strong>Int</strong> –2, <strong>Wis</strong> +4, <strong>Cha</strong> +2<br><strong>AC</strong> 23; <strong>Fort</strong> +14, <strong>Ref</strong> +10, <strong>Will</strong> +16</p>
                   <p><strong>HP</strong> 125, void healing (page 360); <strong>Immunities</strong> bleed, death effects, disease, paralyzed, poison, unconscious; <strong>Weaknesses</strong> alchemical 5 (see alchemical weakness), fire 5</p>
                   <p><strong>Alchemical Weakness</strong> The guardian’s weakness to alchemical items not only applies to damage from alchemical items, but the guardian also takes 5 damage when splashed with non-damaging alchemical items or dosed with alchemical poisons, even if they’re immune to their other effects.</p>
                   <p><strong>Blighted Consumption</strong> [reaction] (curse, divine, poison) <strong>Trigger</strong> A creature within 30 feet eats or drinks (including an alchemical item or potion); <strong>Effect</strong> The food or drink burns like the caustic substances fed to the mummy before its death. If the creature fails a DC 24 Fortitude save, they become sickened 2 after they finish the consumption and can’t reduce their sickened condition while within 30 feet of any mummy.</p>
                   <p><strong>Speed</strong> 20 feet</p>
                   <p><strong>Melee</strong> [one-action] fist +16 (agile), <strong>Damage</strong> 2d10+7 bludgeoning plus Choking Pain</p>
                   <p><strong>Choking Pain</strong> [one-action] (divine, illusion, mental, void) <strong>Requirements</strong> The mummy’s last action was a successful fist Strike; <strong>Effect</strong>The mummy shares the pain of its dying moments with the target of that Strike. That creature takes 3d8 void damage with a DC 24 basic Will save. If the creature critically fails the saving throw, it can’t speak for 1 round, including to Cast a Spell.</p>
                   <br>

                   <p>Of course, we wouldn’t have been able to pull this off at all without having such an amazing group of authors working on the adventures and their support articles. So instead of dancing around spoilers and trying to figure out what to say about this final adventure without revealing too much, let’s hear from two of the authors for this book!</p>
                   <p>(A final note about the art I’m featuring in this blog post—none of it is technically from the adventure itself, but from support articles, so there shouldn’t be anything in these images that will particularly spoil things for anyone who’s eager to discover Season of Ghosts’ surprises as players!)</p>

                   <h3>Jeremy Blum</h3>
                   <p>I'm Jeremy Blum and my articles in Season of Ghosts volumes 3 and 4 will be my first published Paizo projects! For volume 3, I got the chance to flesh out nindorus based on James Jacobs' initial notes, and detailing the intricacies of a delicious new fiend variant was a blast. As for volume 4, let's just say that I was able to write up character options inspired by aspects of Buddhism. I look forward to seeing how players use them!</p>
                   <p>Aside from Season of Ghosts, I've penned portions of the upcoming <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Tian Xia</em><em>World Guide</em> and <em>Tian Xia Character Guide</em>as well as <em>Pathfinder Howl of the Wild</em>. I've also designed Pathfinder conversions for the Korean-themed Undying Corruption setting by Nine Heavens Press, contributed lore to the Chinese-inspired Banner Clans faction in Three Sails Studios’ miniatures wargame <em>Margrave: The Marcher Lords</em>, and most recently worked on several Renegade Games Studios projects that are still under wraps. Check out my portfolio and feel free to follow me (I use the name Pixel Grotto on Twitter and Bluesky) to share stories of how nindorus have made your life miserable.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h3>Liane Merciel</h3>
                   <p>I was both super excited and nervous to be asked to contribute to this Adventure Path.</p>
                   <p>Like a lot of you, I have been a Forever GM for a... well, forever, basically. I think the last time I got to be a PC was, uh, 2006 maybe? No, wait, I did get to play Fumbus for 20 glorious minutes at PaizoCon 2019. So yeah, that’s the last time I was a player in a tabletop campaign.</p>
                   <p>Possibly because of this (vengeful? Me? Never!), my home campaigns are skewed heavily toward horror in all its many and glorious forms. If my players aren’t white-knuckling it and/or grossed out at least once per story arc, I believe that I have failed.</p>
                   <p>Trying to pull off a horror game as a published adventure, though, was a totally different kind of challenge. My GM’ing style is reactive: I see how the players respond to NPC X or Encounter Y and tailor the interaction accordingly. Writing an adventure for players I’ve never met, at tables I’ll never see, using a set of rules that was in flux at the time, was probably more terrifying than anything I’ve ever inflicted on my PCs.</p>
                   <p>But I look forward to putting them through the game later, just to make sure.</p>

                   <p>One final note: If you’re the kind of person who enjoys a good <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOHNx3GvTFbFjc9YQlm9OfybjLw7CZDzO">Adventure Path trailer</a> (that is, a person of culture and taste), you may have taken special notice of the music underscoring the visuals of our latest Season of Ghosts trailer. Those haunting melodies were composed by Filip Melvan of <a href="https://michaelghelfistudios.com/">Michael Ghelfi Studios</a>, with whom we’re excited to announce we’ve entered into an official partnership! Beginning with Season of Ghosts, Michael and his team of award-winning composers will be composing all-new original soundtracks uniquely tailored to accompany selected past and future Pathfinder Adventure Paths!</p>
                   <p>We’ll have plenty more to say in the weeks to come, but for the time being, we’ll leave it at this: players who like to incorporate music into their games can expect a lot of exciting auditory surprises in store!</p>
                   <p>Actually, you know what? That’s not fair. We can’t just tell you about this amazing music and not give you a sample to whet your appetite. <a href="https://downloads.paizo.com/mgs/01_Season_of_Ghosts.mp3">Here’s the title track</a> from the upcoming “Season of Ghosts” album right now, suitable for all your ghost-thwarting, village-protecting, below-the-web-blooming needs!</p>

                   <p>Here’s a look behind the scenes at our PAX Unplugged demo!</p>
                   <p itemprop="description">Hiya, it’s me Jenny Jarzabski (Senior Developer) reporting in from the field! I got to spread some Veskmas cheer by running the playtest demo at Pax Unplugged, and I’m here to tell you all about it! This playtest is an encounter designed to test out some of the basic rules of Starfinder Second Edition. Reading on might spoil the demo’s content, so for those of you planning to attend Owlcon (in February) or Norwescon (in March) where some Starfinder team members might be running this demo, you’ve been warned!</p>
                   <div class="blurbCenter">

                    <p style="font-size: 13px;">Here’s Jenny GMing for one of many amazing demo tables at PAXU!</p>
                   </div>
                   <br>
                   <p><b>PAXU Demo</b><br><b>Map</b>: <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ee8">Starfinder Flip-Mat: Mining Operation</a><br><b>Character Level</b>: 3rd</p>
                   <p>The goal of this demo was to test out what we’ve been working on internally with a wider pool of players and see some early reactions from the community. I won’t be going into extreme detail about everything we tested in the demo, especially since some of those rules may have changed after we implemented feedback and prepared the Playtest Rulebook for the printer over the past two weeks! If you want the full experience, you’ll have to find me or one of my teammates at an upcoming convention or wait for the next batch of demos we’ll no doubt be cooking up for GenCon!</p>
                   <p>Players chose from the following premade characters:</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li>Envoy</li>
                    <li>Mystic</li>
                    <li>Operative</li>
                    <li>Solarian</li>
                   </ul>
                   <p><b>The Fight</b><br>
                     The players approached from the north of a seemingly abandoned mining site strewn with cranes, vehicles, crates, and other large objects providing that sweet, sweet cover. A massive pit in the center of the map created an obstacle for characters favoring melee combat styles. But these lucky gamers were playing a game that favors ranged combat (YEEHAW!) so they all had a ranged damage option in the form of guns! <em>Pew pew pew</em>! Even so, some attacks and abilities perform better in closer quarters. The solarian’s playstyle focuses on getting close to enemies and hitting them with powerful attacks from their solar weapons, and some of the mystic’s spells don’t work from too far away—so not everyone thought it was a good idea to camp out at the edge of the map behind the safety of cover. (Just the operative. Always. So tacticool.)</p>
                   <p>As the players investigated the mine, a trio of pirates popped out from behind cover and fired the first shots of the battle. These pirates were packing guns of their own—machine guns! This meant they could shoot from a distance or get close and unleash a rain of bullets on multiple targets with automatic fire. The pirates’ tactics were to shoot once from a distance, then move in and switch to spraying auto-fire to <em>pew pew </em>as many of their enemies as possible.</p>
                   <br>
                   <p><b>Tactics and Playtesting</b><br>
                     Changing the pirates’ tactics changed the encounter. I experimented with some different tactics and eventually settled into a routine of two pirates following their normal tactics, while a third perched behind a toolchest (cover) on top of the crane. Sometimes, it was like running two battles in one: a sniper fight between crane guy and the operative, and the chaos of machine gun space pirates versus everyone else. Other times, the players disrupted this setup—they gravity welled crane guy off his perch, attacked him with his own shadow, and more! Poor crane guy!</p>
                   <p>The point is, different groups always used different tactics. Patterns emerged, of course. Generally, the operative hung back and kept in cover while sniping, while the mystic slung spells and <em>pew pew</em>’d from a medium distance. Sometimes the mystic even got into melee and used their painglaive to share their emotions with the enemy on a more personal level. The solarian usually charged into battle, either going after the sniper (RIP crane guy) and using abilities to try to drag him off his perch or intercepting the gunners on their way toward the party. The envoy had a lot of choices between shooting and giving directives like Get in There! to boost everyone’s speed, or Kiss It Better to “heal” someone with temporary HP. No two groups I GM’d for used exactly the same combination of actions. Considering each premade character only contained a snapshot of the rules we’ll be playtesting later this year, you should expect a lot of fun choices when you build your first playtest characters.</p>
                   <p><strong>A Note About Pregens<br></strong> he StarFriends (as we members of the Starfinder team call ourselves) each designed one of the premade characters available for the demo. Dustin created the mystic, Jessica whipped up an envoy, Mike crafted a solarian, and Jenny built an operative. Thursty designed the encounter, so we gave the boss a pass this time!</p>
                   <div class="blurbCenter">
                    <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/1fb9c129-3dbc-4e28-9111-329326f96a10/PAXU2023_Crit.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/1fb9c129-3dbc-4e28-9111-329326f96a10/PAXU2023_Crit.jpg" width="80%" style="padding: 10px;" alt="A group of players sitting around a table at the PAX unplugged convention"></a>
                    <p style="font-size: 13px;">Here’s Jenny CRITTING that amazing demo table! Oh no!</p>
                   </div>
                   <br>
                   <p><strong>Bonus Encounter<br></strong> If the players ROFLstomped the pirates, say with a string of crits, the demo had a second encounter loaded in the chamber so the demo wouldn’t run disappointingly short. A fourth pirate gunner and his hacked robot ally emerged from a building and attacked the party right after they defeated the pirates. The robot advanced and went <em>pew pew pew </em>with its laser rifle while the pirate crept up behind it, using her hacked tank-bot as mobile cover until she reached spray-and-pray range. The robot might power down at half HP or use its healing nanites to keep fighting longer, depending on the group. Only a handful of groups played the bonus encounter, including the Cosmic Critters. More about that in a minute.</p>
                   <p><strong>A Veskmas Miracle<br></strong>Playing games with nufriends in the community is always a great time. Thanks to all you gamers at PAX: Unplugged who wandered over to the Paizo tables to try Starfinder 2. Thank you to the GMs who volunteered their time to run demo tables—y’all are some space badasses!</p>
                   <p>Speaking of space badasses, in addition to the public playtests, I had the honor of playing the demo with the wonderful casts of Atomless, Cosmic Crit, and No Quest for the Wicked. They really kept me on my toes with their rolls and roleplay. You can listen to the Cosmic Critmas demo <a href="https://cosmiccrit.com/">here</a>; my sessions with Atomless and No Quest are coming soon!</p>
                   <p><strong>But I Want More!</strong><br>
                     Do you want more teasers about the playtest rules? Are you looking for spoilers before release? Interested in more detailed notes about our internal playtesting? Stay tuned to this space for more news from the StarFriends SOON™!</p>

                   </div>
                   <br>
                   <p>Speaking of <em>Monster Core</em>, you might have seen the big dragon on the cover. This is an adamantine dragon, one of the new primal dragons in the book. Primal dragons draw on the magical energies of the natural world. These dragons tend to be the most bestial among dragons. As a result, they tend to be bulkier with more animalistic features like horns and spines. Some primal dragons even grow natural features on their bodies, like small plants.</p>
                   <p>The adamantine dragon—one of the skymetal dragons—got its name due to the adamantine that covers its body. The magic that flows through them draws adamantine to their bodies like a magnet, though some of these dragons naturally grow adamantine on their body, slowly replacing their hard scales with the skymetal as they age. Regardless of how the adamantine clings to their bodies, these dragons are tough. They’re so tough that they have a strong resistance against physical attacks. The claws and jaws of an adamantine dragon also allow them to burrow through dirt or even solid stone, sometimes emerging from beneath the ground to ambush their prey.</p>
                   <p>Adamantine dragons tend to use their shovel-like mouths to scoop up chunks of earth, consuming whatever rocks and unfortunate creatures are swept up in their bites. Instead of a typical dragon breath, adamantine dragons belch up all of these rocks, unleashing a veritable avalanche from within their bodies. While adamantine dragons typically don’t have the ability to cast spells, they make up for it with their hardy bodies and powerful blows.</p>
                   <p>So, that’s a little bit on the adamantine dragon! Don’t forget to check out this dragon and all of its draconic friends when <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02ej4?Pathfinder-Monster-Core"><em>Monster Core</em></a> releases in March. Stay tuned for more draconic previews in the coming weeks. Next time, we’ll take a look at the mysterious and cunning conspirator dragon. See you then!</p>

Our volunteer GMs are the best of the best, the cream of the crop, and the most helpful skittermanders in the galaxy. Last year, our volunteers ran over 1,000 games online and in person, and we’re looking to exceed that in 2024!</p>
                   <p>If you love our games so much that you want to introduce new players to them, and if you’re ready to GM on the biggest stages we can offer, then we want you to join the team! Even if you’ve never run Pathfinder or Starfinder Society before, our support team will make sure that you have everything you need to run your best games ever.</p>
                   <p>New this year, all GMs who run games at Premier or Premier Plus events will receive a $15 paizo.com voucher per block, which can also be spent in the Paizo booth at Gen Con in Indianapolis. Those who volunteer for more blocks may receive badges to the show, PDF or print products, or hotel rooms based on their commitment.</p>
                   <p>At this time, we’re accepting GMs for <strong>PaizoCon Online </strong>and <strong>Gen Con Indianapolis</strong>; information about Gen Con Online will come once Gen Con provides more information about the event. We’ve also included information from our friends at <strong>Origins</strong>; while Paizo won’t have an official presence there, we’re recognizing them as a Premier event, which means additional rewards for GMs and players. Who knows, maybe you’ll even see some Paizo staff at the event!</p>

                   <h2>PaizoCon Online 2024</h2>
                   <p>PaizoCon Online 2024 will take place online from May 24-27, 2024. It will have a physical component in the form of our PaizoCon@ program; see <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sih9?PaizoCon-Your-Local-Game-Store">last week’s blog</a> for more details. New content at this show includes the launch of Starfinder Society Year 7 (the final year for Starfinder first edition), the new Starfinder Society interactive special, and new Pathfinder Society scenarios.</p>
                   <p>Please note that this year we will be scheduling all PaizoCon Online events on <a href="https://tabletop.events/">Tabletop.Events</a>. As such, GMs will need to create a free account prior to completing the volunteer form.</p>
                   <p>We are currently seeking volunteers for the following roles:</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li><strong>Game Master</strong>: Run tables of Organized Play Scenarios, Bounties, and Quests.</li>
                    <li><strong>Headquarters (HQ)</strong>: Answer player and GM questions, seat players, handle conflicts and disputes, and report games after completion.</li>
                   </ul>
                   <p>Please read this important information before applying:</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li>Volunteer applications will be reviewed and accepted or rejected by the PaizoCon Organizing Committee. Filling this form out <strong>does not guarantee acceptance</strong>; you will receive an email with further information from the PaizoCon committee.</li>
                    <li>PaizoCon Online schedules will be <strong>assigned</strong> by the committee. You will be asked for your preference of system and level, but you will not necessarily be able to choose the specific scenario(s) you run. There is a free-form field at the end of the form to enter specific requests, though there’s no guarantee they will be honored.</li>
                    <li>Reward information is listed in the table below. GMs who do not qualify for a badge will still need to purchase one if they wish to play games.</li>
                    <li>Applications will be processed on a rolling basis, beginning no later than <strong>March 1</strong>. The earlier you get your application in, the more likely it is you’ll get the scenarios you want. Please be patient while we put the final details of the convention together internally before we send out GM emails!</li>
                    <li>Adventure authors interested in running tables of scenarios they have written should fill out this form and then follow up by emailing paizoorgplayhq@gmail.com. Anybody interested in running games outside of the Organized Play offerings (such as Infinite content, homebrew content, or games from other publishers) will be able to propose events once tickets go on sale. Stay tuned for future information!</li>
                    <li>Any questions about the GM signup process should be sent to the committee at <a href="mailto:paizoorgplayhq@gmail.com">paizoorgplayhq@gmail.com</a>.</li>

                   <p>Gen Con Indianapolis will take place in Indianapolis, Indiana from August 1-4, 2024. While we intend to participate in Gen Con Online, this application is <strong>only</strong> for the in-person show. New content at this show includes the launch of Pathfinder Society Year 6, the new Pathfinder Society Special, and the second run of the Starfinder Society interactive special. It will also feature the launch of the Starfinder Second Edition Playtest!</p>
                   <p>We are currently seeking volunteers for the following roles:</p>

                    <li><strong>Demo GM</strong>: Run quick demos for new players, giving them a short Pathfinder/Starfinder experience before quickly turning the table over for the next group. Our Demo GMs may receive an Exhibitor badge in compensation for the fast and furious nature of the position, subject to availability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Board Game Demo GM</strong>: Run demo tables for Goblin Firework Fight and Elemental Stones. Applicants should have strong board game knowledge (both our games and general board games) and preferably have related demo experience.</li>
                    <li><strong>Academy GM</strong>: Run games for young children (under 18) and their families, and provide a safe, welcoming environment for our youngest gamers. This position requires proof of a completed background check (employment in education, public service, or something similar may be accepted as verification that you have completed a background check).</li>

                    <li>Gen Con Indy schedules will be <strong>assigned</strong> by the committee. You will be asked for your preference of system and level, but you will not necessarily be able to choose the specific scenario(s) you run. The committee’s intention is to assign people to run the same scenario multiple times during the weekend, to minimize the amount of preparation required. There is a free-form field at the end of the form to enter specific requests, though there’s no guarantee they will be honored.</li>
                    <li>Reward information is listed in the table below. GMs who don’t qualify for a badge will still need to purchase one.</li>

                    <li>Adventure authors interested in running tables of scenarios they have written should fill out the volunteer form and then follow up by emailing genconleads@gmail.com. Please note that we have a limited number of tables and that the schedule is fairly locked-in at this stage, but we’ll do our best to get you slotted into your scenario if it’s on the schedule.</li>

                   <h2>Origins 2024</h2>
                   <p>Ohio Org Play will again be sponsoring Pathfinder and Starfinder Society at Origins Game Fair from June 19-23, 2024, at the Greater Columbus Convention Center.</p>
                   <p>For those who have not been to Origins in the past, the convention runs from mid-day Wednesday to mid-day Sunday, for a total of 12 event slots. We set our scenario-length slots up as 5 hours of gaming, with 1 hour meal breaks between sessions to give our GMs plenty of time to eat and re-energize. More about Origins can be found here: <a href="https://www.originsgamefair.com/">https://www.originsgamefair.com/</a></p>
                   <p>We are currently seeking volunteers for the following roles:</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li><strong>Game Master</strong>: Run tables of Organized Play Scenarios, Bounties, and Quests.</li>
                    <li><strong>Headquarters (HQ)</strong>: Answer player and GM questions, seat players, handle conflicts and disputes, and report games after completion.</li>
                   </ul>
                   <p>Volunteer applications will be reviewed by the organizing committee. Filling the volunteer form out does not guarantee acceptance. As this is a large con with many moving parts, GM schedules will be assigned by the committee and sent out in order of volunteering. <strong>Volunteer early to lock in your preferences!</strong> Once your schedule is assigned and you confirm, you are considered committed to attending the event.</p>
                   <p>We value each of our volunteers who help to make this event happen. As a reward, we have Ohio Org Play shirts, water bottles, badges, accommodations for you or your vehicle, and bonus Achievement Points to send your way. But wait! This year, there’s more! Paizo has generously stepped in to provide voucher rewards to our GM volunteers this year, as well as free product for those who volunteer for more slots. Here’s a grid to keep track of everything:</p>

                   <p>Designed by me (Joe Pasini) along with Jason Bulmahn, <em>Elemental Stones</em> is the first release in the Paizo Games line, which will consist of tabletop games designed, developed, and published by Paizo. We’re excited to bring you all-new game expressions that, while inspired by and connected to the rich worlds of Pathfinder and Starfinder, explore the opportunities presented by modern games, separate from pen-and-paper roleplaying games.</p>
                   <p>Elemental Stones began life as an inkling of a game inspired by the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02eju">Rage of Elements</a> hardcover book, which dives deep into the system of elements in Pathfinder (including two newly supported elements, metal and wood). We knew we wanted a simple-to-learn, highly replayable game that would involve the elemental cycle, placing satisfying objects on a board, and competing for elemental dominance, in the form of—what else—victory points. Early prototypes of a dotted grid with constellation-like patterns grew into a more robust hex-shaped grid and tokens with a relatively simple ruleset. With just a few tweaks along the way, this design allows for nuanced strategy and tactics each time you play.</p>
                   <p>Of course, as with any idea making its way from concept to concrete creation, there were some growing pains. Various card types were added, patterns shifted and changed, scoring metrics were constantly in flux, and the component list was rather fluid throughout early playtests. For example, we realized players would end up with extra stones at the end of most games and, as a result, would have less meaningful choices when choosing stones in later rounds. We eventually hit upon the idea of awarding points for having majorities in each type of stone as a way to solve two problems with one solution (if only there were a stone-related idiom for that… oh well). Everything about the game went through similar iterations, from the several other ways you can score points all the way to the production side, where we worked diligently with our manufacturer to create tiles that are just the right weight, size, and feel. In the end, we created a game that is quick and easy to play with up to four players in about 30-40 minutes, making it a perfect warm-up to your Pathfinder game night—or you can play multiple rounds for a whole evening of fun.</p>

                   <h3><strong>Great for Players and Game Masters on the Go</strong></h3>
                   <p>Designed for the modern player and Game Master, our Mobile Pathfinder VTT is a great solution for those seeking the thrill of Pathfinder on the go. When you’re playing with our Mobile VTT, you can play anywhere, anytime.</p>
                   <p>Computers and laptops have always been the main devices to play, while mobiles and tablets have been companion devices.</p>
                   <p>We are turning that concept on its head. A mobile phone is all you need to play.&nbsp;</p>
                   <h3><strong>The Player Core Toolkit - The Entry Phase</strong></h3>
                   <p>Our Player Core Toolkit is the entry phase of our VTT. It contains character creation, character sheets, dice rolling with automatic modifiers, and integrated rules accessible on the fly.</p>
                   <p>The Character Creator now contains all classes, ancestries, and heritages available in Pathfinder Player Core with assisted level-up on the way.</p>
                   <p>You can access some rule snippets without owning Paizo’s <em>Player Core</em>. More in-depth rules are accessible for free if you have purchased the Player Core PDF from Paizo*, or you can purchase the Player Core PDF with integration to our platform from us at Natural Pengu for $19.99.</p>
                   <h3><strong>The Next Phase - Mobile VTT Coming On Monday!</strong></h3>
                   <p>But that's not all. We're not just offering a character sheet – we are a full-fledged Virtual Tabletop. Maps, tokens, Game Master tools, and everything you need to create an immersive campaign are on the way with a basic early access version opening on Monday. We are committed to providing a comprehensive Mobile VTT experience that caters to every aspect of your Pathfinder adventure. With these coming functionalities, you can play with a complete VTT, all easily used through a web browser on your phone.</p>
                   <h3><strong>Early Access: Shape the Future with Us</strong></h3>
                   <p>Even though all classes have been tested, our VTT remains in the beta phase with many bugs to be found. You can choose a free plan, or a $1 plan, and get Early access to all of the Player Core Toolkit features.</p>
                   <p>By choosing our $2 plan you will also get Early access to the Natural Pengu Mobile VTT, when it becomes available on Monday.</p>
                   <p>These are limited time offers and prices may increase with time as the platform evolves. So get these low prices while you can! With your support we can keep developing the Natural Pengu Mobile VTT into something truly great.</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">I wanted to take a moment to talk about something new we’ll be doing to help parents and educators who play our adventures with their kiddos.

                   <p>While working on quests, we realized that their 2-hour length was a good sweet spot for younger attention spans, and so we decided to start using this new label on qualifying quests. What that means to us is that the adventure in question should be suitable for younger players without turning off veterans. It should avoid themes of horror or violent imagery, encourage creative solutions, and also employ nonviolent resolutions wherever possible. If there’s a fight, it shouldn’t be against something too scary or too human. The goal here is that if you’ve got a younger child, student, or sibling who can do the addition required to play the game, you can pull out one of these adventures and feel confident that they’ll have as much fun as you will.</p>
                   <p>Happy gaming to all our players, no matter how old!</p>

                   <p>We hope you’ll try the new sheet out, though, and make note of all the things you wish the current sheet could do while comparing it to the new sheet. There will be a feedback form, easily accessed within the community preview sheet, where you can submit your thoughts directly to the team. They plan to adjust their roadmap frequently to ensure you’re getting the features you want the most!</p>
                   <p>In case you haven’t seen the original blog post, this initial community preview of the sheet will include a couple of exciting improvements over the existing sheet:</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Happy 2024, everybody! I don’t know about you all, but I’m still writing 2023 on my checks. Or I would be, if we wrote checks still.</p>
                   <p>We’ve got a great year coming up for you all! The Pathfinder Remaster continues to roll out, the Starfinder 2 playtest will launch, and we’ve got several great conventions spinning up. Not a lot has happened since our last blog (and not to give too much away, but I’m actually writing this four days after the December update went live), so let’s focus on what’s coming soon!</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>Digital Adventure Releases</h2>
                   <p>These adventures will be available on January 31, 2024.</p>
                   <h3>Pathfinder Society</h3>

                   <br>
                   <h2>Premier Plus Convention Recruitment</h2>
                   <p>Are you interested in joining the legion of Paizo volunteers to help us put on some of the best conventions around? Then tune into the blog on <strong>January 18</strong>, when we’ll be posting recruitment for PaizoCon Online and Gen Con Indy GM volunteers! Our volunteers run Pathfinder and Starfinder Society games for hundreds of players, and we’d love to have you join us. Whether it’s your first time GMing or you’re a seasoned veteran, our team will welcome you and give you everything you need to give the players a fantastic experience.</p>
                   <p>This year, I’m pleased to announce that GM rewards for each slot will be increased to a $15 voucher. That means for every slot you run, you get $15 to spend on our webstore or in our booth at Gen Con on anything you like!</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>Pathfinder Remaster &amp; Guide to Organized Play Updates</h2>
                   <p>At the end of December, we published some updates to the <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions">Pathfinder Society Character Options</a> page and the <a href="https://lorespire.paizo.com/tiki-index.php?page=pfs2guide._.Pathfinder-2e-Remaster">Remaster Guidelines page</a>. The primary change here was to re-allow certain spellhearts we previously banned, with some clarifications about how to handle them after the Remaster’s removal of spell schools. It’s heartening to see that we’re getting fewer and fewer questions about rules clarifications, that means things are being answered in a timely manner! Please don’t hesitate to let us know about any outstanding issues.</p>
                   <p>The <a href="https://lorespire.paizo.com/tiki-index.php?page=Pathfinder-Society-(Second-Edition)-Guide-to-Organized-Play">Guide to Organized Play</a> has also been updated! Primarily, this change is to bring text in line with the remaster: changing “flat-footed” to “off-guard,” “spell level” to “spell rank,” and so on. We’ve also added citations referencing both the <em>Player Core</em> and the <em>Core Rulebook</em> where appropriate.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>Sanctioning</h2>
                   <p>After a quiet December, the sanctioning machine roars back to life! This month, expect to see the release of sanctioning documents for the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02eai?Starfinder-Scoured-Stars-Adventure-Path"><em>Starfinder Scoured Stars</em></a><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02eai?Starfinder-Scoured-Stars-Adventure-Path"><em> Adventure Path</em></a>, which I’m <em>extremely </em>excited about, as well as the <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/seasonOfGhosts"><em>Pathfinder Season of Ghosts Adventure Path</em></a>. Additionally, the Starfinder Society Character Options page will be updated with sanctioning for the material found in the <em>Angels of the Drift</em> comic series.</p>
                   <p>In March, we’ll be dropping sanctioning for <em>Seven Dooms for Sandpoint</em>, as well as the new <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02et8?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-Seven-Dooms-for-Sandpoint"><em>Pathfinder Monster Core</em></a>.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>GM Ranks</h2>
                   <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p>
                   <p>This month, we had two GMs earn their 5th rank!</p>
                   <p><strong>5th Glyph (PFS2)</strong>: Landon Hatfield, Eric Parker</p>
                   <br>
                   <p>Happy new year, everybody! Until next time - Explore! Report! Cooperate! And get ready for convention signups!</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Happy New Year! Welcome to the exciting reveal of our <a href="https://downloads.paizo.com/Starfinder_FieldTest_3.pdf"><b>third Starfinder Second Edition Field Test</b></a>.</p>
                   <p>It’s a new year and a new Field Test release! The Field Tests include early, behind-the-scenes previews of rules the Starfinder development team is playtesting internally in preparation for the <em>Starfinder Playtest Rulebook</em> release later this year. Our latest offering includes a preview of two ancestries appearing in the <em>Playtest Rulebook</em>, as chosen by community vote. We’re excited to announce the winners of that vote and the ancestries we’ll be featuring in today’s Field Test: the android and vesk!</p>
                   <p><strong>Ancestries</strong> are the updated version of what were known as <em>species</em> (also called <em>races</em> in older products) in Starfinder First Edition. Ancestries are an important part of Starfinder’s “cantina feel,” a term referring to the sci-fi trope of a spaceport bar packed with all kinds of aliens. In this context, it means players get to create and play as alien characters, and every planet or space station in the setting is teeming with weird and wonderful sapient lifeforms that player characters might interact with. Our goal is to keep the cantina open, so to speak, while we update existing Starfinder ancestries to be compatible with the new edition.&nbsp;</p>
                   <p>Starfinder ancestries might look familiar to those of you who play Pathfinder Second Edition. Starfinder First Edition players might notice the new ancestries are a bit of a departure from what you’re used to, but don’t panic! In Starfinder Second Edition, each ancestry entry includes more content than the small sidebar allotted to them in Starfinder First Edition.</p>
                   <p>In existing Starfinder books, you’ll often see a species boiled down to a list of statistics with a handful of abilities. Presenting species this way allowed the Starfinder team to introduce many playable options right away, but there was little players could do to define their character’s progression—via their species—beyond the initial selection. In some specific cases, a species was so numerically superior that they were the obvious “best” choices (we’re looking at you, SROs!). This was fantastic for certain players but didn’t always reward players interested in exploring different options. In the new edition of Starfinder, we want to create deeper meaning and context for ancestries that you’re going to play or feature in your campaigns. This means including more space for narrative lore related to each ancestry and information on how it fits into the setting, as well as progression-based selections to help further customize a character of that ancestry.</p>
                   <p>In addition to a set of starting adjustments and abilities, ancestries in Second Edition get access to ancestry feats. A character gains an ancestry feat at 1st level and then another at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th-level. Ancestry feats explore different paths within each ancestry and grant more powerful abilities as a character progresses—allowing you to customize your character beyond what was possible in Starfinder First Edition. The team’s been experimenting with some interesting new options, like expanding lashunta psychic powers or introducing a type of shirren that grows wings!</p>

                   <br>
                   <p>Today’s Field Test focuses on the constructed androids and the reptilian vesk. Androids and vesk are both staple ancestries in Starfinder, but each represents a very different part of the design spectrum. Androids already exist in Pathfinder Second Edition (see <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq026k5">Pathfinder Lost Omens: Ancestry Guide</a>), so the Starfinder team updated the ancestry to be compatible with the “ancient androids” who once walked lost Golarion while creating new options to represent the changes in culture and technology that separate the Starfinder setting from its distant past.</p>
                   <p>Meanwhile, vesk is an ancestry that’s never appeared in Pathfinder Second Edition, giving us a blank canvas to work with. Our intent was to keep the spirit of the First Edition vesk while exploring new build types, from movement-based shenanigans to different forms of natural melee attacks, and more.</p>
                   <p>The team is excited to see what you think of our initial foray into ancestry design for the new edition. We also <strong>strongly suggest </strong>you read the foreword in this document, which may reveal some important news related to what ancestries you can expect to see in the <em>Starfinder Playtest Rulebook</em> releasing this summer!</p>
                   <p>Stay tuned for our upcoming Paizo Live! where members of the Starfinder team will further discuss the Field Test, as well as give more hints about what we have planned for the new edition of Starfinder.</p>

                   <p>Pathfinder and Starfinder Infinite is a program that allows you to create content (adventures and locations; monsters; character classes, archetypes, and backgrounds; fiction; etc.) based on Paizo’s intellectual property (IP), including Pathfinder’s Lost Omens campaign setting, and to make some money while you’re at it. Your work might even be recognized by the community and earn you an invitation into the Infinite Masters elite creator program.</p>

                   <p>Titles are ranked by an average of units sold and revenue earned and presented in alphabetical order. Asterisks indicate titles that have been on a best-seller list previously. Because they’ve consistently topped the list, and due to the number of their titles that typically take up spots, “Team+” and “Team Index” have asked to be removed from the calculations for ongoing top performers lists. This will allow newer publishers or book series to get more attention. Thanks, all!</p>

                   <p>A new socialite has appeared on the scene! I haven’t <em>actually</em> seen her in person, since last month I was in the Mwangi Expanse talking about ships, <em>ugh</em>. But she’s apparently quite wealthy and quite lovely, keep your eyes peeled for Duchess Hesla Embersplitter!</p>
                   <p>Oh, right, I was asked to mention this:</p>
                   <p>If any of you have seen Kitsch’s favorite marble pestle, she’d appreciate it if you’d make sure it makes its way back to the Office of Procurement and Supplies before the end of the year. She needs it to powder some poison arrows and help prepare her popular ginger and cardamom cookies for the holiday party. She last saw the pestle when she was putting it in her left cheek pouch.</p>
                   <p>Anyway!</p>
                   <p>The Waterfall has been wandering around the Grand Lodge lately, sending people on all sorts of missions to various islands! I tried to poke my head into a meeting and was informed by her that my “natter wasn’t currently re­­quired for such a delicate meeting.” If any of you know what that word means, I’m eager to learn myself.</p>
                   <p>A handsome visitor has come to visit our own Fola Barun, perhaps for a lovely Crystalhue dinner? He’s a lovely fellow by the name of Yellick Broadcoat and seems to have rolled into town just in time for the festival of the winter solstice!</p>

Fortunately for most (hopefully all) of us, we won’t have to worry about the supernatural threats that are coming to a head in the poor little town of Willowshore, during which the story finally reaches its climax and the PCs must grapple with a revelation that hopefully comes as a surprise to all who play this Adventure Path!

                   <p>The original plan to present Season of Ghosts as a four-part Adventure Path was originally born out of a desire to set up the 200th volume of Pathfinder as a special double-sized book (more on that in a few months), but now that Season of Ghosts is coming out, I’m particularly pleased with two things that came about because of this choice. First, it let me organize the Adventure Path according to the four seasons, which gave the adventure authors some fun themes to work with and encouraged everyone to come up with some memorable uses for downtime in the campaign. Second, it let me structure the story using kishotenketsu (special thanks again to James Case for the great suggestion)! This is a traditional four-act story structure used in Chinese, Korean, and Japanese narratives in which the major turning point/narrative crescendo/plot twist of the story happens not in the final act, but the penultimate one. Hence my comment in the previous paragraph about this adventure serving as Season of Ghosts’ climax! This gives us an entire adventure (coming next month) to focus on the results and ramifications of the story and wrap things up with some new and intense developments of their own, resulting in what I think is not only a truly memorable campaign, but in what is certainly one of the Adventure Paths I’m the proudest to have been a part of. (And not just because it let me get a lot of cat artwork in print!)</p>

                   <p>Hi everyone! I’m Dan Cascone, and I’ve crawled out from under my rock to join Eleanor Ferron in writing <em>No Breath to Cry</em>. You may remember me from contributions to books such as <em>Pathfinder Dark Archive</em>, <em>Pathfinder Treasure Vault</em>, <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Highhelm</em>, and the upcoming <em>Pathfinder</em><em>Howl of the Wild</em>. I look forward to hearing about all your horrible deaths and triumphant victories over the challenges we’ve put in the adventure.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h3>Eleanor Ferron</h3>
                   <p>Hello! I'm Lost Omens senior developer Eleanor Ferron, and I teamed up with co-author Dan Cascone to write the third volume of the Season of Ghosts Adventure Path, <em>No Breath to Cry</em>. As a fan of Asian horror and horror-adjacent media such as <em>Onmyouji</em>, <em>Kuon</em>, and <em>Fatal Frame</em>, as well as the supernatural shenanigans of <em>Inuyasha</em> and <em>Goblin: The Great and Lonely God</em>, I enjoyed getting to bring all these inspirations into the world of Pathfinder. I hope you survive your time in Willowshore, and hopefully even have fun doing so. Be nice to foxes, don't go near the baskets, and always carry a camera to catch ghosts.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h3>Michelle Y. Kim</h3>
                   <p>Hi, this is Michelle! I’m a Korean American TTRPG writer and designer who contributed some backmatter to Season of Ghosts, and I am so excited for you all to meet some truly terrible little guys (and maybe not so little guys) in the haunted lands of Shenmen. As a lover of both folklore and horror, this project was a delight, and I look forward to hearing about everyone’s adventures. Currently I'm working on a Joseon Dynasty setting supplement for <em>Good Society: A Jane Austen RPG</em> by Storybrewers Roleplaying, which I talked a bit about on the Asians Represent! Podcast. You can find me on Twitter as @_missmyk_ or at Bluesky at @missmyk.bsky.social. I've recently joined the Paizo team as a developer and will be helping create more wild adventures from the other side of the screen!</p>

                   <p itemprop="description">Season’s greetings, Pathfinders and Starfinders! It’s December, which puts us right in the middle of a whole host of holidays and celebrations. We’ve reached out to our staff and contributors to ask about their favorite traditions for the winter (or, in the case of our southern hemisphere friends, summer) holidays!</p>

                   <h3>Eren Ahn (they/them)</h3>
                   <p>Hello! I’m Eren (they/them, primarily), and you’ll see some of my work in the upcoming Lost Omens Tian Xia books for Pathfinder Second Edition. My family didn’t have too many winter traditions growing up (I got presents on Christmas for the first ten years of my life and tteokguk (rice cake soup) on New Year’s after that), but since I started living on my own, I adapted some traditional dongji rituals to celebrate the solstice. For me, this means making patjuk (red bean porridge) and leaving a small bowl of it on my windowsill overnight for any wandering spirits. I’m fond of winter, cold snaps and polar vortexes and all, and it’s a calming ritual to look forward to in my generally fast-paced life.</p>

                   <h3>James Jacobs (he/him)</h3>
                   <p>I’m James Jacobs (he/him), Narrative Creative Director for Pathfinder, and for me, the winter holidays are traditionally when I wander some 800 miles south to spend time with my family and to relax in my hometown of Sandpoint/Otari/Point Arena. There were a few years there during the pandemic when this tradition got interrupted, but things are mostly back to normal there. Bad weather might step in to keep me here in Washington (as it has a few times in the past), but otherwise the long journey south beckons with its promises of hanging out with family, relaxing in the redwoods of Northern California, visiting some local landmarks (during Thanksgiving I visited the Point Arena Lighthouse, which is the tallest lighthouse on the west coast of the United States, and which you’ve also seen if you watched movies like <em>Forever Young</em> or <em>Need for Speed</em>), and hoping for a bigfoot sighting or two.</p>

                   <p>Hi everyone, I’m Joshua Birdsong. I am a designer for Paizo. I am very excited and humbled to be part of such an amazing team, and I look forward to helping create some awesome books for all of you! My favorite holiday tradition is consuming an entire container of chocolate hazelnut pirouline wafers on Christmas day! If you need to get in touch, you can find me on Twitter at @impr0phet. Don’t forget to be awesome!</p>

                   <h3>Lynne M. Meyer (she/they)</h3>
                   <p>Hello! I’m Lynne (she/they), the newest member of Paizo’s editing team. I’m pagan but grew up in a Protestant family. My holidays aren’t complete without pfeffernusse, a traditional German spice cookie. When I was growing up, my German grandmother lived with us and taught me to bake. She had pfeffernusse every Christmas—and only at Christmas. I looked forward to it every year.</p>
                   <p>When she passed, the tradition stopped. Years later, when I started dating the man who’d become my husband, I decided to bring it back. I even used my grandmother’s antique measuring cups.</p>
                   <p>It turned out that pfeffernusse is his favorite cookie! Pfeffernusse became my signature bake. Pre-pandemic, I’d make as many as ten dozen to share with our families. Times are different now, and those celebrations are happy memories. Circumstances make it difficult to see our families in person, and I’ve since lost my father as well as a brother.</p>
                   <p>Yet pfeffernusse remains part of my Yule. It’s the one holiday tradition I keep without fail. It ties me to my past and my present with love. Every year, when the aroma of anise hits me, I’m a little girl again, celebrating Christmas with my family.</p>

                   <h3>Rue Dickey (they/he/xe)</h3>
                   <p>Growing up and living in a very mixed-culture household means I celebrate a wide variety of holidays during December (Christmas Eve with my in-laws, Chanukah, the Solstice, and “Witch-mas” with my mom—Christmas day, but it’s goth and we make hot chocolate and exchange gifts). One tradition that transcends all of these holidays, though, is making fudge!</p>
                   <p>I use my grandmother’s fudge recipe (included below), which has been handwritten, photocopied several times, and taken a picture of via a phone to wind up in my hands. It makes 5 pounds of fudge—no more, no less, and no ratio editing allowed. And now you can make it too!</p>
                   <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
                   <ul>
                    <li>4 ½ cups of white sugar</li>
                    <li>2 cubes (8 oz) of butter</li>
                    <li>1 (12 oz) can of evaporated milk</li>
                    <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>18 oz semi-sweet chocolate chips (or semi-sweet chocolate, chopped)</li>
                    <li>1 (7 oz) jar of marshmallow fluff</li>
                    <li>2 cups chopped nuts (optional)</li>
                   </ul>
                   <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
                   <ol>
                    <li>Cook the sugar, butter, evaporated milk, and vanilla over medium heat until the mixture comes to a slow boil.</li>
                    <li>Beat with electric mixture for seven (7) minutes, continuously. 
                     <ol>
                      <li>My wife and I take turns holding the mixer for this step, as it can start to ache.</li>
                     </ol></li>
                    <li>Remove from heat.</li>
                    <li>Add in chocolate chips, marshmallow fluff, and nuts (optional).</li>
                    <li>Stir until all ingredients are well mixed.</li>
                    <li>Pour into 13” x 9” baking pan and chill in fridge until set (about 2 hours). 
                     <ol>
                      <li>If you’re like me and want to eat hot, kind of un-set fudge, half an hour on the counter is enough to make it cool enough to eat, but still warm and soft.</li>
                     </ol></li>
                    <li>Cut into cubes and enjoy.</li>
                   </ol>
                   <p>(Makes five pounds)</p>

                   <p>Here in Argentina the holidays are during summertime. In the coast city in which I live, we usually spend the days going to the beach, and resting at home after that. Some card and board games are often played as well. On Christmas and New Year's Eve I meet with my family, and many others from my father's family, and get some asado (fantastically grilled meat from here). After midnight, once presents are opened, or exchanged, or a toast is made if it's New Year's Eve, it's time to meet with friends, where we spend the rest of the night playing games, might get a holiday-themed one-shot going, and go see the sunrise together when it comes.</p>

                   <p>Hello again Pathfinders!<br>
                     This month we’ve got another quest for you. It turns out the previous queen of Irrisen left numerous magical dollhouses in storage within her palace at Whitethrone. The current queen, Anastasia—short on allies and trying to make sense of the strange magics of the land she now rules—has turned to the Pathfinder Society to investigate, and sent one of the dollhouses over to Absalom. However, with the various threats to the Society that have occurred in the past year, both the dollhouse and the investigation have been largely ignored. This is quite unfortunate for you, our intrepid adventurers, for magical schemes of the hag we all love to hate, Aslynn, have inadvertently reactivated the dollhouse’s magic. As it turns out, these dollhouses were once magical prisons, shrinking prisoners down to doll size. Can you find a way to escape the Winter Queen’s Dollhouse?</p>
                   <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02es8?Pathfinder-Quest-16-The-Winter-Queens-Dollhouse"><em>Pathfinder Quest (Series 2) #16: The Winter Queen's Dollhouse</em></a> is an adventure suitable for even our youngest Pathfinders (and any others who happen to be 1st- through 4th-level) written by Brite Cheney.</p>

                   <p>Over in Arcadia this month, the Pathfinder Society has been asked to participate in an old ceremony meant to reestablish good relations with local spirits and ensure the continued safety of the settlement of Niishan. This is a great honor, one bestowed on the Society for their work last year to repatriate the star gun Hatahasi back into their home. As the Pathfinders explore the village and work to prepare for the first night of the festivities, they’ll need to contend with a spirit of the land who’s not so sure about their presence.</p>
                   <p>Once the sun goes down, a spirit of unnerving size and unwavering fury awaits, ready to see Niishan’s ceremony fail so that he may seek revenge…</p>

                   <h2>OPC Musings</h2>
                   <p itemprop="description">Hello everyone, and happy December! This blog is a week later than usual because I’ve just returned from PAX Unplugged, which was a tremendous success! It was our first visit since 2019, as well as my first visit overall, so I wasn’t sure what to expect. My worst fear was that nobody would be interested in our games, and we’d be sitting around all day bored out of our skulls.</p>
                   <p>I am delighted to report that we had the exact <em>opposite</em> problem. We got a <em>ton</em> of attention from attendees, many of whom were excited to talk about the Pathfinder Remaster and pick up the newest books. Our retail partner, Card Titan, ran out of books by the end of the show!</p>
                   <p>But by far the biggest star throughout was Starfinder 2! We ran alpha demos of the game, which were a roaring success. We had attendees waiting <em>hours</em> in line to play, and everyone who walked away from the table was excited about the new edition. I can’t wait until we get to start showing it off to a wider audience!</p>
                   <p>With that said, let’s dive into our update!</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>Digital Adventure Releases</h2>
                   <p>These adventures will be available on December 20, 2023.</p>

                   <h2>Lorespire Wiki</h2>
                   <p>Last month, the hosting for the Guides to Organized Play went down for a couple of very chaotic weeks. I’m delighted to announce that they are back online in their new home, the <a href="http://lorespire.paizo.com/">Lorespire Wiki</a>! You can access this wiki at <strong>lorespire.paizo.com</strong>. This is a Paizo-hosted server, so it should remain online for as long as the rest of our website is.</p>
                   <p>Our Guide Team has been hard at work both restoring service and updating the Pathfinder Society Guide to be in line with the Remaster. In coming weeks we’ll also be looking at hosting additional resources here, such as region homepages to help players find games. Stay tuned for new and exciting things on this front!</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>Pathfinder Remaster</h2>
                   <p>The Pathfinder Remaster launched last month to great success! The books have been flying off the warehouse shelves, and Pathfinder Society characters are converting like never before! A reminder that the guidelines for these changes are available on the <a href="https://lorespire.paizo.com/tiki-index.php?page=pfs2guide._.Pathfinder-2e-Remaster">Lorespire Wiki</a>.</p>
                   <p>We’ve made a couple of updates to the <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/characteroptions">Character Options</a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/pathfindersociety/faq">FAQ pages</a> since the launch, so be sure to keep an eye on those for future changes. Thank you all for your patience and understanding, and for your helpful questions in the forum threads as we stamp out any issues. It’s our hope that all this work will make the launch of <em>Player Core 2</em>next summer as smooth as possible.</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>2024 Major Conventions</h2>
                   <p>This is just a heads-up that very soon, we’ll be soliciting GMs for PaizoCon Online as well as Gen Con Indy! Stay tuned to the Paizo blog for more information on this in January but mark your calendars now. We’re hoping to make both conventions better than ever before, and to do that we need talented volunteers like you!</p>
                   <br>
                   <h2>GM Recognition</h2>
                   <h3>Campaign Service Coins</h3>
                   <p>This month, several new Campaign Service Coins were awarded at local conventions! We award these coins to members of the community who have gone above and beyond to provide an exceptional program to the community at large. Campaign Coins are awarded based on nominations; if you believe someone in your community is deserving of this award (whether they are a Venture Officer or not), send an email to organizedplay[at]paizo[dot]com with their name and the reasons they deserve the award.</p>
                   <p>Congratulations to:<br><strong>Wally Waltner</strong>, who now holds a campaign coin and OP ID #872<br><strong>Barb Crase</strong>, who now holds a campaign coin and OP ID #901<br>
                     and <strong>Nicholas Ruchlewicz</strong>, who now holds a campaign coin and OP ID #906</p>
                   <h3>GM Ranks</h3>
                   <p>Whether stars, novas, or glyphs, achieving a 5 ranking in any program involves a substantial amount of time. To achieve the 5th milestone, a GM must run 150 games, of which at least 50 must be unique scenarios and 10 must be special scenarios, as well as run between one and three games for venture-captains (program dependent). A conservative estimate of the time needed to reach the 5th milestone is 650 hours!</p>
                   <p>This month, we had one GM earn their 5th rank!</p>
                   <p><strong>5th Glyph (PFS2)</strong>: Doug Edwards (our third 5/5/5 GM!)</p>
                   <br>
                   <p>That’s all from me! Until next time - Explore! Report! Cooperate! I’ll see you next year!</p>

                   <p>The Pathfinder Society is invited by Mayor Deyahi to take part in a special traditional ceremony known as the Festival of Fire! This ceremony has been performed for generations and is always an honor for the group of warriors chosen to defend the sacred bonfire. While it's expected that there will be several spirits and undead appearing throughout the evening, what Niishan is unaware of is the fact that an unknown figure has been watching the ceremony for its entirety, waiting for the time that the warriors are weak enough to make their move. With the Pathfinders appearing to fill this role, they see their chance to attack and make Niishan feel their ancient wrath. It's up to the PCs to hold off this villain and the other spirits, ensuring that the ceremony is successful and Niishan remains safe!</p>

                   <p>The ruler of Irrisen, Queen Anastasia, found a number of strange dollhouses when going through her aunt's vaults. She sent one to the Pathfinders for study. When Aslynn's magic was unleashed in the vaults of Skyreach, the dollhouse's magic was reactivated. In reality, these dollhouses were prisons that would shrink down those who angered Elvanna, the former queen. Now the magic is poised to ensnare the PCs. What's more, the animate doll servants have awakened as poppets, and while some are happy to help, others are not so welcoming.</p>

                   <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02efv">Starfinder Enhanced</a> takes center stage this go around. This includes clarifications on how the enhanced witchwarper can take advantage of their alternate class features, some significant boosts to biohacker snipers and medics, and fixes to the DC of some troublesome feats. We also updated the back-matter of a handful of Adventure Path volumes, including the starsinger archetype from <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02asc?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-47-Nightmare-Scenario">Starfinder Adventure Path #47: Nightmare Scenario</a> and the plane-touched species from <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02dv1?Starfinder-Adventure-Path-46-The-Perfect-Storm">Starfinder Adventure Path #46: The Perfect Storm</a>. Almost every hardcover has some level of errata, but perhaps the biggest change involves some clarifications to the Starfinder Roleplaying Game system itself, including official clarification that you can now intentionally hit a willing ally without an attack roll, and an explanation of how characters with a 0 ft reach can engage in melee combat! There are many other changes and, as always, we welcome more questions, comments, and feedback on our Rules Questions <a href="https://paizo.com/community/forums/starfinder/rules">forums</a>. And feel free to discuss this errata right here on this blog post!</p>
                   <p>Continued thanks to our Organized Play Program for finding many of these concerns!</p>
