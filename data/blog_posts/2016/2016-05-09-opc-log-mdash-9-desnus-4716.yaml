               <p itemprop="description">Last Friday, the <a href="http://www.gencon.com/experience/find" target="_blank">Gen Con event listings</a> launched! With all the offerings available, searching the catalog can be daunting. So the team put together some highlights to aid in planning. From 8:00 AM on Thursday until 2:00 PM on Sunday, the Sagamore Ballroom will ring with the sounds of dice, combat, and Venture-Captain briefs.</p>

               <h2>Roleplaying Guild Scenarios</h2>
               <p>Every scenario from <a href="/products/btpy9gwx/"><em>#7-09: The Blackros Connection</em></a> through <a href="/products/btpy9mbc"><em>#8-03: Captives of Toil</em></a> is available, as well as the evergreens <a href="/products/btpy92ci"><em>#5-08: The Confirmation</em></a>, <a href="/products/btpy9a1y"><em>#6-10: The Wounded Wisp</em></a> and <a href="/products/btpy9hgx"><em>#7-10: The Consortium Compact</em></a>. The multipart "Faithless and Forgotten" series will run in consecutive slots, so it will be possible to play the three parts (<a href="/products/btpy9huv"><em>#7-14: Let Bygones Be</em></a>, <a href="/products/btpy9hux"><em>#7-16: Lost Colony of Taldor</em></a>, and <a href="/products/btpy9huz"><em>#8-18: The Infernal Inheritance</em></a>) in order. For each scenario, the Gen Con website shows a short descriptive blurb that appears in the program book and a longer blurb available online. The longer blurbs for the Season 8 adventures weren't available at the time of event submission, so I've included them here to give everyone a taste of Season 8 flavor.</p>

                 <p>A Pathfinder Society Scenario designed for levels 1-5.</p>
                 <p>Even in an age where prophecy rarely comes true, many in Varisia hold the mysterious Harrow cards and their predictions in high esteem. The Pathfinder Society's ally Zeeva Foxglove recently received a Harrow reading as repayment for her generosity, but a rare card appeared and portended imminent doom. Now that these terrible predictions are coming true, Zeeva realizes she cannot weather this storm alone. It's up to the PCs to save this friend and philanthropist—perhaps by changing fate entirely.</p>

                 <p>A Pathfinder Society Scenario designed for levels 3-7.</p>
                 <p>The legendary sorceress Hao Jin transferred many abandoned historical sites to her museum demi plane, though even her magic had limits, forcing her to transport only part of an architectural treasure. The half of a temple she left behind in the jungles of Dtang Ma has developed a haunted reputation in the centuries since. Now an unlikely ally has approached the Society with tales of unspoiled historical secrets and hidden treasure left within the shattered sanctuary of Yamatsumi, the mountain god.</p>

                <div class="spoiler-text">
                 <p>A Pathfinder Society Scenario designed for levels 5-9.</p>
                 <p>Two years ago, the Pathfinder Society concluded its extended campaign to find, reclaim, and explore the lost sky citadel Jormurdun. After ousting the vile demons and duergar within, the Society turned over control to their dwarven allies, who have defended the ancient fortress ever since. A recent raid by duergar slavers has captured some of Jormurdun's dwarves, who have disappeared into the Darklands and bound for the cruel capitol of Hagegraf. Only the Pathfinder Society is equipped and able to launch a daring rescue into the lightless depths, intercept the slaver convoy, and save these dwarves from a grisly fate.</p>
                 <p>Content in "Captives of Toil" also contributes directly to the ongoing storyline of the Liberty's Edge faction.</p>

               </div>
               <p>After much deliberation and because they have the potential to run long, we scheduled the new Seeker Arc, "All for Immortality" across the morning slots. We are offering Part 1 (<a href="/products/btpy9k93"><em>#7-20: First Taste of Eternity</em></a>) on both Thursday and Friday, Part 2 (<a href="/products/btpy9m01"><em>#7-26: All the Gods Beyond</em></a>) on Friday and Saturday, and Part 3 (<a href="/products/btpy9m02"><em>#7-29: Serpents Fall</em></a>) on Saturday and Sunday. This gives players the best chance to finish the arc at the event. The GMs for these tables are among the best, familiar with running in a convention setting and adjudicating high-level combat. While they have the potential to run long, we felt the opportunity to play through the arc with friends from other areas provided a benefit that couldn't be passed up. So prepare your team and come see if your character is worthy of the title "seeker".</p>
               <h2>Adventure Card Guild Scenarios</h2>
               <p>Adventure Card Game Designer Tanis O'Connor asked me to save them for her to preview. So I will leave you with an... tic... pa... tion for tomorrow's blog.</p>
               <h2>Pregenerated Character Specials</h2>
               <p>The popularity of <a href="/products/btpy9cu0"><em>#6-98: Serpents Rise</em></a> and <a href="/products/btpy9cu6"><em>#6-99: True Dragons of Absalom</em></a> led us to plan two more scenarios with pregenerated characters. Thursday afternoon, we reprise some tables of <em>Serpents Rise</em> for those attendees who haven't experienced it yet. Thursday evening sees the Sagamore engaged in <a href="/products/btpy9lzy"><em>#7-98: Serpents' Ire</em></a>, a continuation of the Aspis Consortium storyline. On Saturday, we delve into Season 8 with <a href="/products/btpy9mbd"><em>#7-99: Through Maelstrom Rift</em></a>. Sunday morning sees repeats of both pregen specials, as well as For those Gen Con attendees unable to make Thursday or Saturday night, Sunday morning sees repeats of both new specials. <em>True Dragons of Absalom</em> is on offer several times throughout the convention.</p>
               <div class="blurb360">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20160509-Photo.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20160509-Photo_360.jpeg"></a>
               </div>
               <h2>Interactive Special</h2>
               <p>This years special, titled <a href="/products/btpy9mbe"><em>#8-00: The Cosmic Captive</em></a> and authored by Matt Duval, starts at 8:00 PM on Friday night. In past years, we ran 160 Roleplaying Guild tables, spanning levels 1 through 11. This year, we are keeping 160 Roleplaying Guild tables and adding 20 Adventure Card Guild tables. All 180 tables will work together to achieve common goals, and the actions of one effect the outcomes of others.</p>
               <div style="padding: 10px;">
                <b>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-00: The Cosmic Captive</b> <input type="button" value="Show" class="spoilerButton" onclick="toggleSpoiler(this)">
                <div class="spoiler-text">
                 <p>Astronomers have marveled as the famous comet Aucturn's Tear once more soars through the solar system, yet this cycle, strange portals have begun opening on each planet the comet passes, and a powerful entity trapped on the other side of these gateways desperately calls for help. To the Pathfinder Society, this is a once-in-a-human-lifetime opportunity to discover what lies through these portals—and either free the captive trapped within or ensure that it remains sealed forever.</p>
                </div>
               </div>
               <p>Based on feedback concerning the number of tables available to players of each level, this year you may purchase tickets for a particular sub-tier. While this aids us in allocating GMs to the proper sub-tier, it presents a challenge to the player to ensure their character remains at the correct level. Be sure you purchase tickets for the level your character will be at the convention!</p>
               <h2>Pathfinder Society Academy (PSA)</h2>
               <p>Pathfinder Society Academy incorporates the Kid's Track adventures of previous years, as well as youth friendly tables of <em>The Confirmation</em>, <em>The Wounded Wisp</em> and <em>The Consortium Compact</em>. It provides a place for our younger GMs to hone their skills under the leadership of adult mentors. This year, we added <em>Kid's Track Transitions</em>, a new series of lessons and quests aimed at bridging the gap between the original Kid's Track lessons and full Roleplaying Guild play. When completed, the player receives a chronicle with enough experience, prestige, and gold to make a second level Pathfinder Society character.</p>
               <h2>Demonstrations</h2>
               <p>There will be quite a few demos going on! In the Exhibition Hall, Adventure Card Game demos of the upcoming <a href="/products/btpy9mbg"><em>Mummy's Mask Base Set</em></a> will be held next to the Paizo Booth. In the Sagamore Ballroom, scheduled demos include <a href="/products/btpy9mb9"><em>Pathfinder Society Quest: Honor's Echo</em></a> for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and the <a href="/products/btpy951a"><em>Rise of the Runelords Base Set</em></a> for the Adventure Card Game.</p>
               <h2>Seminars</h2>
               <p>We've planned a full complement of seminars, starting Thursday at 11:00 AM and continuing through Sunday at 2:00 PM. Some old favorites, like "Aunt Lisa's Story Hour", Mark Moreland's "Become a Pathfinder Sage", and the ever popular "Ask the Paizo GMs" are back, as well as new offerings. Join Ben Loomes to chat about using sound, especially Syrinscape, as mood enhancement at the table. Or see what's in store for the Pathfinder Comics line with "Pathfinder Comics: Hollow Mountain and Beyond". If you're interested in running a convention, visit us on Thursday at 6:00 PM to learn some of the tips of the trade. With a wide range of offerings, attendees are sure to find something to pique your interest.</p>
               <p>All of these games utilize volunteers as GMs, as well as a full complement behind the scenes making things happen. To those that signed up, thank you. It wouldn't be possible to hold Gen Con without you! For those still thinking about it, I have a handful of Tier 1 GM positions available. For more information, check out the <a href="/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lie2">Gen Con 2016 Call for Volunteers</a> blog and follow the registration instructions found there.</p>
               <p>Last, but not least, let me introduce to the Lead Volunteers for 2016! These individuals do it all—scheduling, volunteer organization, setup, tear down, and everything in between. This year brings back the Terrific Trio of Jon Cary, Bob Jonquet, and Todd Morgan. Tune in on Saturday to learn more about our stalwart leaders!</p>
