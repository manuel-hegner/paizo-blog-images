                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20190509-Seoni.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderRPG/20190509-Seoni_500.jpeg"></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">She’d rather you actually got with the plan, but at least get out of fireball radius.</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>Seoni’s art has historically been a bit flashy, but I really like her new serious and driven aesthetic in Pathfinder Second Edition.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/112919_RotRCharacterSeoni.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/112919_RotRCharacterSeoni_500.jpeg"></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/112919_RotRCharacterSeoni2.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/112919_RotRCharacterSeoni2_500.jpeg"></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Find some allies and monsters, and Seoni will show them who’s boss.</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>Rise of the Runelords Seoni could enjoy the fun of spellcasting without worrying about recharge checks, and also had a backup power for when she was caught without an Attack spell in hand. This made her a great starting character, which is handy since I remember her being very popular for new groups picking characters before understanding the mechanics.</p> 
                <p>With everything important based on Charisma, you’d get to enjoy the excellent d12 most turns, and picking skill feats was a breeze. Card selection and card feats could require more thought, though. After blithely ignoring weapons and armor, Seoni loaded up on 5 blessings, 4 allies, and 3 each of spells and items. This let her explore very well, but meant that you might quickly run into some difficult choices about what spells to keep around. If you didn’t take many Attack spells, you’d likely soon find out that her character power was a great backup option, but a little anemic for important combats.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/112919_SorcererClassDeckSeoni.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/112919_SorcererClassDeckSeoni_500.jpeg"></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/112919_SorcererClassDeckSeoni2.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/112919_SorcererClassDeckSeoni2_500.jpeg"></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">As much Sorcerer-ing as Runelords, now with more Class (Deck).</p> 
                </div> 
                <p><i>Sorcerer Class Deck</i> Seoni adds Knowledge to her skill list, playing up a bit more of the detail-oriented and planner side of her background. She also swaps her Attack power from Fire to Force. This makes her less good at killing some monsters like Trolls, but a whole lot better at fighting a number of Fire-immune monsters like Devils. She also trades out her automatic spell recharging power for a bonus to acquire Magic boons. If you’re used to playing other casters already, or you play in a large group, that’s probably a decent trade.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/112919_WotRCharacterSeoni.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/112919_WotRCharacterSeoni_500.jpeg"></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/112919_WotRCharacterSeoni2.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/112919_WotRCharacterSeoni2_500.jpeg"></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">A slightly more Wizardy Sorcerer.</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>Wrath of the Righteous Seoni went off in a different direction from the previous two versions. She only recharges Attack spells (and items), and doesn’t have the power to do an Attack spell whenever she wants. In trade, she has an extremely nifty power to draw Arcane or Magic cards directly from her discard pile and occasionally draws extra cards on acquires. She’ll want to make sure to stock up on some good Attack spells; thankfully, Wrath of the Righteous has a whole bunch of awesome ones, and she has 2 more spells in her deck. She’s also swapped Diplomacy for Perception and can add armor to her deck. Probably a decent call for ventures into the Worldwound.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/112919_CoreSetCharacterSeoni.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/112919_CoreSetCharacterSeoni_500.jpeg"></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/112919_CoreSetCharacterSeoni2.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/112919_CoreSetCharacterSeoni2_500.jpeg"></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">New style, same raw power.</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>Of all the <i>Core Set</i> characters, Seoni follows most in the footprints of her previous incarnations. Her Runelords powers just make her the perfect choice for introducing new players to spellcasting. That said, we can’t help but switch things up. Her Attack power is more reliable, especially at high level, and a single power feat makes it a lot cheaper to use. Another power feat lets her shuffle spells into her deck on recovery: a nice option once you know which cards you want to force higher in your deck.</p> 
                <p>Seoni is a bit more diverse in her skills than Runelords, starting with Knowledge and able to pick up Perception in a role. Her art has always had a staff and dagger, so she’s the first Seoni to start with a weapon. Thankfully, both the Dagger (assist a local combat) and Quarterstaff (evade an Obstacle or Trap) are pretty solid for her in Core and she can always convert them into an Arcane Attack.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/112919_CoreSetSpellDeflect.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/112919_CoreSetSpellDeflect_500.jpeg"></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/112919_CoreSetItemWandofEnervation.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/112919_CoreSetItemWandofEnervation_500.jpeg"></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">That “freely” makes Deflect an essential tool in the Sorcerer’s box.</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>Spells are her bread and butter, and she doesn’t need too many Attack spells because of her power. This lets her take protective, utility, and assisting spells if she wants, or choose a greater variety of Attack options. With a single power feat, she can also pick up some solid Arcane items like the Wand of Enervation.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/112919_CurseSpellGiantForm.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/112919_CurseSpellGiantForm_500.jpeg"></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/112919_CurseSpellScrying.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/112919_CurseSpellScrying_500.jpeg"></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Giant Form makes a mockery of the words “Immune to Attack.”</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>Seoni can safely load up on the highest level difficult-to-recharge spells she can get her hands onto. Giant Form and Scrying are fun and effective options that Ezren and Kyra might have real difficulty consistently recharging. They also convert well with Seoni’s Attack power.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/112919_RotRBlessingofPharasma.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/112919_RotRBlessingofPharasma_500.jpeg"></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Pharasma: goddess of birth, death, fate, prophecy, rebirth, fighting undead, and making Seoni awesome at casting spells.</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>In character, Seoni has always been devoted to Pharasma, even leading us to adjust the Pharasman blessings in Rise of the Runelords to make them a better fit for Seoni. In Core, both Pharasma’s Knowing and Lady of Mysteries lean into the undead-fighting aspect of the Lady of Graves while also being useful for Seoni, allowing her to cycle her deck around to have the right cards in hand before pressing onward.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/112919_CoreRoleSeoniCelestialRunecaster.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/112919_CoreRoleSeoniCelestialRunecaster_500.jpeg"></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/112919_CoreRoleSeoniDreamweaver.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/112919_CoreRoleSeoniDreamweaver_500.jpeg"></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">I also believe we can reach the morning light.</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>Seoni’s Celestial Runecaster role builds on the concept that she <a href="https://www.aonprd.com/BloodlineDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Celestial">draws her sorcerer power from a celestial origin</a>. This role builds on her Attack power, both in effectiveness and in adding the ability to deal Divine damage (useful for bypassing resistance or immunity). She gains bonuses when blessed and at thematically Sacred locations. She gains occasional (end of turn) flight, and resistance to damage like a celestial creature. All solid, effective options.</p> 
                <p>Her Dreamweaver role embraces her Varisian background and devotion to Pharasma to learn to see and pull the strings of fate. She becomes somewhat of a <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sh09?Varian-Jeggare-Deckmaster">deckmaster</a>, with powers to cycle her deck and ensure she can get her favorite cards back into hand. She can gain the Perception skill and assist her party against barriers. It benefits from a little more thought and planning, and occasionally your friends will screw up your plans. <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5la75?Meet-the-Iconics-Seoni">And that’s sometimes what being Seoni is about</a>.</p> 
                <p>That’s our new Seoni! She’s still a straight-forward badass d12 chucker of energy magic and Diplomatic ways, but she’s got some new cool options to add complexity as she gains levels.</p>

                <p>I’m James Jacobs, and I wrote about Runelords and Linnorm Kings and Winter Witches and other Saga-worthy Stuff in this book. A certain amount of what lives today in Golarion first came to be in my homebrew setting, which I’ve been working on since the 80s… but today, Golarion is so much more than that! I’d like to take this chance to thank everyone else who has helped build up Golarion over the years, be they any of the amazing writers I feel so honored to be counted among in this book, but also every other writer out there who’s contributed to Golarion lore. And ESPECIALLY thanks to Eleanor and Luis, who hit the ground running with the daunting task of developing and organizing the Lost Omen line of books—Golarion couldn’t be in better hands!</p> 
                <h3>Lyz Liddell</h3> 
                <p>I'm Lyz, a game editor-turned-designer who had the privilege of updating the Shining Kingdoms for the World Guide. Working on this section was a fun opportunity to decide how some of the oldest nations of our campaign setting have fared given the epic events occurring around and within them—some for the better, and some for the worse! While rolling dice and writing new ways to roll them is my day job and a big chunk of my free time, my degrees are actually in music performance and am a passionate professional performer of medieval, renaissance, and baroque music. I specialize in recorders, other wind instruments, and viola da gamba, though I’m always finding and learning how to play new old instruments. You can check out my writing and musical work at <a href="http://www.LyzLiddell.com" target="new">LyzLiddell.com</a>, and I tweet pictures of outer space and my cats for everyone to enjoy at <a href="http://twitter.com/LyzMayTweet" target="new">@LyzMayTweet</a>.</p> 
                <h3>Ron Lundeen</h3> 
                <p>I’m Ron Lundeen, and I’ve been a developer here at Paizo for nearly two years. Adventures are the thing I love most; when I’m not developing adventure path volumes during the day, I’m often writing adventures for Pathfinder, Starfinder, or other systems at night. But every good adventure needs a gripping setting, and I was thrilled to contribute to the Lost Omens World Guide. I’d just finished developing the Tyrant’s Grasp Adventure Path at the time, so I knew quite a lot about the Gravelands (the nation formerly known as Lastwall) and the Whispering Tyrant. Because I’d contributed to the Ironfang Invasion Adventure Path as an author and freelance developer, I also knew quite a bit about Nirmathas and the new hobgoblin nation (which I got to name!). The Eye of Dread is a rough region, and I was very excited to lay it out for everyone for our new edition! You can check out my RPG advice, including a free Pathfinder Second Edition adventure path I’m writing, on my blog at <a href="http://RunAmokGames.com/" target="new">RunAmokGames.com</a>.</p> 
                <h3>Erik Mona</h3> 
                <p>Over the last decade, I’ve been accumulating a 90,000-word continuity document on everything we’ve ever published about the city of Absalom. From the names of minor streetsweepers mentioned in a Pathfinder Society scenario to details on the many times the city has come under siege, it’s all gone in there to make sure we don’t mess anything up when we inevitably make room in the schedule for a <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq021bz?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Absalom-City-of-Lost-Omens">big Absalom book</a>. With that enormous research project in hand, I snagged the Absalom and Starstone Isle section of this book, and used it as an opportunity to flesh out the rest of the Isle of Kortos. Given the island’s huge size, I knew that it must contain more than just a couple of other towns and a big mountain, and the Lost Omens World Guide gave me the opportunity to set that stuff down for the first time. We’ll be fleshing out Kortos in the upcoming <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/extinctioncurse">Extinction Curse</a> Adventure Path, and I couldn’t be more excited! I’ve also long had my creative marker on the Impossible Lands, which I invented way back for the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy82t7?Pathfinder-Chronicles-Gazetteer">Pathfinder Chronicles Gazetteer</a>, which offered me a chance to add more flesh to one of Golarion’s most mysterious and exciting regions! What a joy to get to watch the campaign setting develop from a badly drawn map and a few pages of notes that started way back in 2006!</p> 
                <h3>Mark Seifter</h3> 
                <p>I'm Mark Seifter, game designer and one of the four leads on the creation of Pathfinder Second Edition. Check out my twitch stream with Linda Zayas-Palmer, Arcane Mark, Tuesdays and Thursdays at 7PM Pacific, and Saturdays at 10 AM Pacific at <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/arcanemark" target="new">https://www.twitch.tv/arcanemark</a>. We cover a variety of RPG and Pathfinder topics on Tuesdays and Saturdays, chosen by the viewers, with interviews on Thursdays!</p> 
                <h3>James Sutter</h3> 
                <p>I’m James L. Sutter, former Paizo Executive Editor, developer, and Starfinder Creative Director. Since that first gazetteer of Varisia in <i>Pathfinder Adventure Path #3</i>, I’ve spent more than a dozen years writing about Golarion, and been honored to work alongside some of the most creative people in the business as we watched a handful of proper nouns and graph-paper maps transform into the living world it is today. So when the folks at Paizo offered to let me help usher the setting into a new edition, I leapt at the chance to revisit my first fantasy home. (The fact that they let me play with some of my favorite toys didn’t hurt, either. I’ll forever be a champion of godless Rahadoum, which led me to write my first novel, <i>Death’s Heretic</i>. And how could I resist Hermea, with everyone’s favorite problematic dragon lord...) These days you can find me on Twitter at <a href="http://twitter.com/jameslsutter" target="new">@jameslsutter</a> or over at <a href="http://jameslsutter.com" target="new">jameslsutter.com</a>. In addition to writing novels, comics, and RPG adventures, I also teach online classes in writing and worldbuilding, in which I share what I've learned from my time on Pathfinder and Starfinder.</p>

                <p>I’m John Compton, recently organized play lead developer and now Starfinder senior developer. When I started working at Paizo about 7 years ago, I quickly became the local gnome enthusiast, and it’s been a delight to carry that passion into Second Edition by writing about our gnomes and our expanded understanding of how they absorb and ultimately bleed magic based on the four magical traditions. As we explored non-human ethnicities, these seemed a fun way to show how the eclectic gnomes’ features vary less by ancestry and more by local eldritch phenomena.</p> 
                <p>If you’d like to hear more from me, I frequent Twitter (<a href="http://twitter.com/Archaeotagh" target="new">@Archaeotagh</a>) and several Pathfinder, Starfinder, and Organized Play servers on Discord. Definitely check out my more recent works like the Adventure Path volumes <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zno?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-144-Midwives-to-Death">Pathfinder #144: Midwives of Death</a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq02065?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-149-Against-the-Scarlet-Triad">Pathfinder #149: Against the Scarlet Triad</a>; Pathfinder Campaign Setting books like <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01vao?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Faiths-of-Golarion">Faiths of Golarion</a> (Tsukiyo), <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01x4d?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Concordance-of-Rivals">Concordance of Rivals</a> (aeons, inevitables, and creation myths), and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zow?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Druma-Profit-and-Prophecy">Druma, Profit and Prophecy</a> (history, culture, and faith). I love writing about our setting, its history, its cosmology, and its cultures, and there’s a lot more of that to come in <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq021bz?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Absalom-City-of-Lost-Omens">Pathfinder Lost Omens: Absalom, City of Lost Omens</a>! </p>

                <p>Hi all, my name is Sasha Laranoa Harving, but I've been credited as Sasha Hall and Sasha Lindley Hall in the past. I wrote the dwarf section of Lost Omens Character Guide, and I'm really happy with what I got done! I tend to write for a number of 3rd Party publishers, and some of my proudest accomplishments are the Successor Base Class from Lost Spheres Publishing (<a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/259539/Classes-of-the-Lost-Spheres-Successor" target="new">found here</a>), and the Mythos Mystic Connection from Everybody Games (<a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/241525/Star-LogEM026-Mythos-Mystic-Connection" target="new">found here</a>), although my body of work has a few more items than that. I hope that my work can grace your tabletops soon!</p>

The Organized Play program holds a special place in my heart, so it was an honor to write about the Pathfinder Society in the <em>Lost Omens Character Guide</em>. Writing new mechanics for a system-in-progress was a challenging and rewarding experience that deepened my appreciation for Pathfinder's new edition. I am grateful to be able to contribute to the games that have played such an important role in my life. Another way I show thanks to the community is by running Freelance Forge, a forum for RPG freelancers. You can learn more at <a href="https://freelanceforge.boards.net/" target="new">https://freelanceforge.boards.net/</a>, or get in touch with me personally on <a href="http://paizo.com/">Paizo.com</a> or at <a href="https://twitter.com/_MikeKimmel" target="new">https://twitter.com/_MikeKimmel</a>.</p> 
                <h3>Ron Lundeen</h3> 
                <p>I’m Ron Lundeen, a developer on the Pathfinder adventure path line here at Paizo. I’m also a big fan of little halflings. When we talked internally about establishing ethnicities for non-human ancestries, I came to the meeting with about a dozen handouts and two pages of notes on othobans and mihrinis and other ethnicities I’d invented. So I had a lot to say during that meeting, and I jumped at the chance to write the halfling section of this book. I love that the little flourishes I wrote—like hallinettes and bill-bands and slang terms—all made it in. But halflings weren’t all I wrote about! I’d recently described the new hobgoblin nation of Oprak in the <em>Lost Omens World Guide</em> and was eager to create the new hobgoblin ancestry. This was a bit of a struggle, because the hobgoblins presented in the <em>Bestiary</em> aren’t too smart, but the hobgoblin focus on military strategy and alchemy in our world led me to insist they had to get an Intelligence bonus. I’m glad that carried the day! You can check out my RPG advice, including a free Pathfinder Second Edition adventure path I’m writing, on my blog at <a href="http://RunAmokGames.com/" target="new">RunAmokGames.com</a>.</p> 
                <h3>Matt Morris</h3> 
                <p>In 2015, encouraged by an amazing group of creative friends, I made a showing in RPG Superstar, and that experience pushed me to explore writing for 3rd-party companies. I’ve been lucky enough to work extensively with <a href="http://everybodygames.net/" target="new">Everybody Games</a> and <a href="https://www.roguegeniusgames.com/" target="new">Rogue Genius Games</a>, producing a variety of rules options for Pathfinder and the popular <a href="http://everybodygames.net/starfarers-companion" target="new">Starfarer’s Companion</a> for Starfinder.</p>
                <p> Recently, I’ve enjoyed working with a talented group of collaborators at Paizo, beginning with my contributions to the <em>Starfinder Armory</em> and <em>Alien Archive 2</em>. My work on Pathfinder Player Companions has had me <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01vb0?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Martial-Arts-Handbook" target="new">body slamming</a>, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01w1y?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Wilderness-Origins" target="new">bushwacking</a>, and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01yji?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Chronicle-of-Legends" target="new">relic hunting</a> my way through Golarion, and writing back matter for an Adventure Path has even taken me to the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws3?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-139-The-Dead-Roads">Boneyard</a>! The Lost Omens line for Pathfinder Second Edition has given me the opportunity to explore some of my favorite parts of the setting, and I can’t wait for everyone to see what is in store from the line in the future! For the <em>Lost Omens Character Guide</em>, I wrote the Firebrands, Hellknights, Knights of Lastwall, and Magaambya Adepts in the NPC Gallery. </p>
                <p> I keep an up-to-date list of my work on my Paizo profile, and I’m always looking for interesting projects, so feel free to send me a message via the forums if you are looking for a reliable writer!</p>
                <p> When not writing, I’m teaching high school English near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. </p> 
                <h3>Patchen Mortimer</h3> 
                <p>I'm an ad agency copywriter and DJ from Baltimore. (Those ads where the kids ran the gummi bear factory—I wrote those!) But most people know me from <em>The Daily Bestiary</em> (<a href="https://dailybestiary.tumblr.com" target="new">dailybestiary.tumblr.com</a> and <a href="https://dailybestiary.blogspot.com" target="new">dailybestiary.blogspot.com</a>), where I spent 7+ years writing adventure seeds for nearly every monster in the Pathfinder <em>Bestiaries</em>. For Paizo, I typically write articles for <em>Pathfinder Adventure Path</em>—mostly ecologies, adventure seeds, and gazetteers for GMs. Shining a light on some overlooked corner of the game is pretty much my favorite thing to do, so working on the “Lizardfolk” and” Other Ancestries” sections of the <em>Lost Omens Character Guide</em> was a fantastic chance to do that for players, too! I hope all your iruxi PCs hit level 20. </p>
                <p> Please find me on Twitter @<a href="http://twitter.com/patchdj" target="new">patchdj</a>. If your game world needs new cultures, subraces, settings, or lore, we can talk freelancing at <a href="mailto:patchen.mortimer@gmail.com">patchen.mortimer@gmail.com</a>. If you're a publisher interested in a system-neutral fantasy project (or an artist interesting in collaborating), definitely reach out.

                <h3>Andrew Mullen</h3> 
                <p>Howdy! I wrote about the Magaambya—my favorite Golarion organization! —and figured I’d share my thinking process for the venerable institution’s 2e debut. Three bits of information were my ‘pillars’ when I was considering Magaambyan history and organizational structure: they’re about 8,000 years old; they’re capital-g Good; and no attacker has ever gotten within 20 miles of Nantambu.</p>
                <p> What sort of organization lasts that long with that little (successful) aggression toward it? One with allies! Especially with the established Magaambyan focus on spreading knowledge, it made sense to me that the Magaambya had stuck around so long because they had good working relationships with their geographic neighbors. That idea lead to the five branches’ community-oriented duties and purviews, the contemporary Magaambya’s interest in helping groups outside of the Mwangi Expanse (plus the recent and intriguing ‘big magic’ events in Avistan), as well as the Perquisite, the traditional service period associated with entry into the organization.</p>
                <p> That said, I think a cooperative Magaambya still leaves room for adventure-driving conflict and tension. Magaambyans can fly off to help those in need, sure, but there’s also the frustrations of a large organization trying to build consensus and affect greater change. That can spin off into all kinds of stories!</p> 
                <h3>Mikhail Rekun</h3> 
                <p>Приветствую, уважаемые читатели! My name is Mikhail Sergeyevich Rekun, and I am a Paizo freelancer who has previously worked on The Half-Dead (AP #139) and several Companions, with much more to come. Outside of gaming, I’m a Russian-American historian and educator, with a doctoral degree from Northeastern University, presently employed at Times College Nanjing. My research focus is late Imperial Russian foreign policy, and I’ve published a book on the subject, <a href="https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781498559638/How-Russia-Lost-Bulgaria-1878–1886-Empire-Unguided" target="new">How Russia Lost Bulgaria, 1878-1886: Empire Unguided</a> (Lexington Books, 2018). </p>
                <p> My academic background means that when I write for games, I spend a lot of time thinking about the interplay of societies and individuals, what in historiography is called the concept of historical agency. How are choices constrained by upbringing, how can one person change a culture? In the <em>Lost Omen Character Guide</em>, where I wrote the human ethnicities, this meant asking what it meant to grow up Vudrani, or how a Taldan background can influence someone. Hopefully, the results did not disappoint.</p>
                <p> Forthcoming publications include a large part of Absalom, City of Lost Omens, a few sections in the Advanced Player Guide, and two AP backmatter articles. Professional inquiries and effusive praise may be directed to <a href="mailto:MRekun@Gmail.com">MRekun@Gmail.com</a>. </p> 
                <h3>Owen K. C. Stephens</h3> 
                <p>I’m Owen K.C. Stephens, and this is one of my first Pathfinder 2nd Ed credits! I was a tad surprised when I was told I was an author for this book, since the work I did was originally slated for another project. But, that’s one of the important things developers like Eleanor Ferron and Luis Loza do. They look at the needs of multiple projects, and put work where it does the most good and makes the most sense.</p>
                <p> Since leaving my position as Paizo’s Starfinder Design Lead, I’ve taken a position as developer for Green Ronin’s Fantasy AGE rpg, and been focusing on my blog (<a href="http://owenkcstephens.com" target="new">owenkcstephens.com</a>), and producing game material and rpg writer and developer advice supported by my Patreon (<a href="https://www.patreon.com/OwenKCStephens" target="new">https://www.patreon.com/OwenKCStephens</a>). </p> 
                <h3>Isabelle Thorne</h3> 
                <p>Hello there! My name is Isabelle Thorne (though I previously wrote as Isabelle Lee), and I’ve been a contributor for a few years now. I’ve written for all the Pathfinder and Starfinder lines except Starfinder Society. While my work often centers on mechanical content, I enjoy writing flavor content when I can; as a trans girl, I prioritize LGBTQ+ inclusivity in my work.</p>
                <p> For the <em>Lost Omens Character Guide</em>, I wrote some elements for the elf section (most notably the ancient elf heritage and the Vourinoi ethnicity) and the Knights of Lastwall section. Being able to shape and define this organization from scratch was absolutely thrilling, and I hope you all love them as much as I do. ^_^</p>
                <p> You can find me here on the forums and on Twitter at <a href="http://twitter.com/ThornyRoseGames" target="new">@ThornyRoseGames</a>, and I’m always potentially open to work opportunities and sensitivity reading. In addition, I now have a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/ThornyRoseGaming" target="new">Patreon</a>! I’m planning to release new content there on a monthly basis, covering both editions of Pathfinder as well as Starfinder. Feel free to check it out! </p>

                <p itemprop="description">I was two-thirds of the way through a hybrid power converter and already feeling the buzz when a knock on the door caught me off guard. In itself, that shouldn’t have been strange; I’m a private detective, after all. But I’d turned the sign off a week ago. Sentient Robotic Investigations—the only SRO detective agency in the Burning Archipelago—was closed. Figuring someone’d gotten lost, I opened the door to send them away. Instead I found a korasha lashunta waiting, her features as symmetrical as anyone could ask for, wearing an annoyed scowl that brought with it a surge of memories of the old days.</p> 
                <p>“Chief Maneon,” I said, waving her in and tipping the power converter in her direction. “I’d buy you a charge, but I think I already spent it.” She didn’t laugh. I’m not very funny.</p> 
                <p>She’d come to tell me about a stiff—a ysoki, washed up in the canal in Bulwarks Plaza. Eventually I realized she was offering me a job. “Last time I checked,” I said dryly, “you were in charge of a bunch of cops.”</p> 
                <p>“We’re slammed,” she said. “Too many cases, not enough hands. You remember things at Laubu Station.” I did, but I was also thinking of how I was going to refill my drained power converter.</p> 
                <p>“Rate’s two hundred a day, plus expenses.”</p> 
                <p>She accepted without hesitation. That’s when I should have known better. “A person’s dead,” she said on her way out the door. “All I want to know is, what are you going to do about it?”</p> 
                <p>I tossed the spent battery on the table. “As little as possible.”</p> 
                <p>I tried the canal, but it was a bust. Holo-tape marked off the scene where they’d dragged the poor rat—a guy named Bey—out of the water, but there was nothing to see. The locals along the green promenade didn’t seem to notice in any case. Not far off, a small crowd gathered around local doomsayer Jenaelyn, whose ravings about a pending armageddon were far more interesting than anything I had going on.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/112119_TftDTheLongSunrise.jpg"><img style="max-width:100%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/112119_TftDTheLongSunrise.jpg"></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Mark Molnar</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>Bey managed an apartment building in Clearlight and I headed in that direction. It was a hike, and by the time I got there my circuits were throbbing. I was not in a good mood. Of course, the door was locked, so I jimmied it. I couldn’t exactly ask the landlord to let me in.</p> 
                <p>Inside was a warren. Typical ysoki. I wove a path between boxes of cheap electronics and used drone parts. There was a whole rack filled with nothing but obsolete datapads, and a handful of credsticks by the bed. His union certification was framed on the wall. I liked him. But there was a weird signal coming from behind the desk; it was wired. Crawling under there, I saw a security panel. I tried his union member number, and a panel in the wall slid open. I went in.</p> 
                <p>It was a small little space, cozy even for a ysoki. He’d hung monitors all over the walls, and half of them were still running. On the screens, people—mostly lashuntas in black—sat huddled together in molded plastic seats, checking their comms or talking quietly to each other. A few people stood nearby, holding onto brass poles that led from floor to ceiling. It was the inside of a linecrawler. Bey had bugged the linecrawlers. What the hell for?</p> 
                <p>All the camera feeds were recorded. There were hundreds of hours. My headache was telling me I didn’t want to watch them all, but it turned out I didn’t have to. Fifteen minutes were missing from a recording three days old. Bey had erased it. I locked up as I left. But I took the credsticks.</p> 
                <p>Half of the credsticks bore the logo of the Last Laugh—a local comedy club—so that’s where I went. Tonight, the batteries were on Bey. Chaz Bilgart, the club’s most celebrated act, was on stage, making a finger pistol with one hand. “‘Didn’t you hear me,’” he snarled, imitating a mugger in a cheap holonovel. “‘Hand over the credits or I blow your damn brains out!’ And I told him, ‘Gimme a second, okay? I’m thinking!’” I didn’t get the joke, but everyone else laughed.</p> 
                <p>I saw a lot of off-duty cops in the room, but I rolled in anyway and ordered a battery from a waiter dressed like a mourner. Bey’s sticks had plenty of credits. I didn’t know if I could drink my way through all of them, but I was ready to try. I was halfway through my second when Chaz dropped onto the chair next to me. “J4K3, you look like crap.” I couldn’t disagree, so I showed him a picture on my comm without a word. “That’s Bey,” he said. “Nice guy. Tips good. Is he in trouble?”</p> 
                <p>“Not anymore.” I told him about the canal.</p> 
                <p>Chaz told me Bey had been in three nights ago, pretty upset. Had too many. A local took him home. When I asked who, he pointed across the room to a table where a bunch of big palookas sat around a less boorish, far more handsome local. “Zeylan,” he said. </p> 
                <p>“Bey talk to anyone else?”</p> 
                <p>“One of the waiters, Lin,” he said. “But Lin didn’t show for his shift today.”</p> 
                <p>I didn’t like my odds against the palookas, so I waited for Zeylan to leave and I followed him. Chaz insisted on tagging along. We ended up at a storage facility which Zeylan entered. I got Maneon on the comm and told her everything. She was there in ten minutes.</p> 
                <p>“Killer is in there?” she said.</p> 
                <p>“And probably another dead guy,” I told her.</p> 
                <p>I was ready to bust the door down but she just knocked. “Sir,” she said through the door. “It’s Chief Maneon.”</p> 
                <p>After a short pause, the door opened a crack. Zeylan had a pistol pointed at the floor. “Shavri,” he said. nonchalantly. “Who are your friends?”</p> 
                <p>Maneon didn’t acknowledge Zeylan’s familiar address and ignored the question. “You need to go, sir. Is there a body in there?”</p> 
                <p>Zeylan shrugged. “I’m afraid so.”</p> 
                <p>“Leave it. I’ll take it to the crematorium. With all due respect sir, if you’d let me take care of the first one, none of this would have happened.”</p> 
                <p>A numb feeling had been spreading through my circuits, but I finally lost it when I realized the chief wasn’t calling Zeylan “sir” as a formality, but rather as a sign of deference. I lifted my arc pistol, but Chaz held me back, giving Zeylan the chance to slip out the door and bolt. And just like that I was watching his back as he ran for the linecrawler station.</p> 
                <p>Maneon looked at me like she’d just swallowed a bug. “Holy hell, J4K3, put that thing away before you hurt someone!”</p> 
                <p>“You knew the whole damn time!”</p> 
                <p>“I didn’t know how the ysoki overheard what he did. But now we’ll destroy the rest of those recordings. This is your fault. You should have done what you promised you’d do.”</p> 
                <p><i>As little as possible</i>, I’d told her.</p> 
                <p>She turned away to see to the corpse waiting in the storage unit. As the door closed, I made a last lunge to hold it open, but Chaz was stronger than he looked.</p> 
                <p>“Forget it, J4K3,” he hissed in my ear. “It’s Asanatown.”</p>

                <p itemprop="description">Before we proceed with this month’s Pathfinder Society releases, we wanted to update our community on the status of the Playtest Points (PtP), which is holding up the launch of the Achievement Points (AcP) system.</p> 
                <p>We believe we’ve found and corrected the logic errors responsible for the inaccuracies in the PtP buying system. At the same time, we’ve introduced some upgrades for the administration of the program. These are both important steps on resolving the outstanding issues. While we haven’t gotten the boons attached to the purchase button – that is involved in a more comprehensive overhaul – you can find sample copies of the boons linked throughout our site, including <a href="https://paizo-images.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/image/download/PTP+Rewards-FINAL(with+watermark).pdf">here</a>. These changes go live on <b>Monday, November 25, 2019</b>. At this time, we are <i>zeroing out</i> all PtP purchases made from launch to date and putting those points back in your PtP pool. We ask that you repurchase any items already bought. You do not have to rebuy any item for your character, but must remove the associated PtP assets that aren’t rebought.</p> 
                <p>One other note – after bouncing about on the schedule, the Organized Play blogs are <b>moving to Thursday</b> starting December 1st. Tune in then for another update on the program, as well as our celebration of our community.</p> 
                <p>And now, I hand the blog to Linda, who will give us a sneek peek into our scenarios releasing next week. </p>

                <p>With many of us in the United States getting ready for a feast next week, it’s time to talk about what the Pathfinder Society team has cooking up for you in November!</p> 
                <p>First up, we have <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq021x4?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-108-Revolution-on-the-Riverside">Pathfinder Society Scenario #1-08: Revolution on the Riverside</a>, brought to you by Kalervo Oikarinen. Journey to the tiny River Kingdom of Artume on the trail of a hidden chapter of the Pathfinder Society’s past. But this mission isn’t as simple as retrieving old records. Artume’s people have recently deposed a tyrannical ruler, and a young new king has risen in his wake. The Pathfinders find themselves wrapped into a political situation balanced on a knifepoint, one so tenuous that the PCs may well be the ones to choose the kingdom’s fate.</p>

                <p>Take to the seas in this month’s second adventure, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq021x5?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-109-StarCrossed-Voyages">Pathfinder Society Scenario #1-09: Star-Crossed Voyages</a>, by Paizo editor Lu Pellazar. The land of Vidrian (until recently known as Sargava) wishes to rekindle an old trade relationship with the iruxi city of Ekkeshikaar to the south. There’s only one problem—the last time Vidrian’s ships sailed that far south was before the massive and unrelenting hurricane known as the Eye of Abendego fundamentally reshaped the coastline and changed the currents. With vague references and scraps of old maps as a guide, the PCs and a contingent from the Horizon Hunters, including Calisro Benarry, sail south to chart a new course. The journey doesn’t go according to plan, however. After strange currents, sea monsters, and a mysterious and bizarre phenomenon pull the PCs off course, they need to work with newfound iruxi allies to find their way back.</p>

                </div> 
                <p>And last but not least, this month’s delightfully-named quest: <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq021xi/discuss?Pathfinder-Society-Quest-4-Port-Peril-Pub-Crawl#1">Quest #4: Port Peril Pub Crawl</a>. Join the merriment in Port Peril, a thriving port known as a haven for piracy. When the rum flows and tempers flare, these pirates aren’t afraid to get their hands dirty in a pub brawl of epic proportions. This repeatable quest features three different drinking establishments, each with its own flavor of mayhem. The author of this playful adventure is Paizo developer James Case. In case you missed the announcement in Tuesday’s blog, James Case has recently joined the organized play team, and we’re all super-excited to have him on board.</p>

                <p><a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq021wi?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-211-Descent-into-Verdant-Shadow">Starfinder Society #2-11: Descent into Verdant Shadow</a> is a Tier 3–6 scenario that comes from the pen (errr, keyboard) of veteran freelancer, Larry Wilhelm. For players who’ve been involved in Paizo Organized Play, Larry’s name should come as no surprise, as his bibliography of scenarios is too long to list in a single blog post. In Descent into Verdant Shadow, Larry weaves an adventure that takes the PCs down into the depths of an Aballonian Ice Well—a jungle carved under the planet’s surface by ancient meteor impacts. Down in the depths of this frozen verdant landscape, the PCs discover an unexpected complication and must hurry to avert a catastrophe that could affect the entire region. As with most of his scenarios, Larry also provides some exceptional maps to go along with a fun stand-alone adventure that may prove to have some importance in future scenarios!</p> 
                <p>Look at this plant-creature who’s going to help our PCs in their journey!</p>

                <p>Did you know that I like collecting things? I play a lot of miniature wargames, so I collect those. I enjoy computer games where loot drops and I get to collect all of that. One special “collection” I’ve worked to complete over the years has been an attempt at getting as many members of the Starfinder team to write Organized Play scenarios as possible. Of the current team, I’m only missing two*. <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq021wj?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-212-Colossus-Heist"><i>Starfinder Society #2-12: Colossus Heist</i></a>** brings that count down to one missing staff member as Paizo’s own, Amanda Hamon, giddily (and with some story-related bribery) agreed to tackle Starfinder’s first adventure to the colossus-infested world of Daimalko! Since Amanda created Daimalko and did the writing to flesh it out in our upcoming <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zud/discuss?Starfinder-RPG-Near-Space">Starfinder Near Space</a> book, she was the perfect candidate to write a high-level scenario that takes our players right into conflict with the dreaded colossi of that world! No spoilers here; you need to play this scenario to believe I ever got the premise into print!</p> 
                <p>Much like our first scenario in November, our trek through Daimalko is going to involve the PCs getting to know a certain NPC. Let me assure you, this damai understands the purity of unarmed combat!</p>

                </div> 
                <p>One other point I’d like to highlight for this month’s releases, is the help of Jenny Jarzabski! You may know Jenny from her work on <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9x0w?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-107-The-Solar-Sortie">Starfinder Society #1-07: The Solar Sortie</a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zn3?Starfinder-Society-Scenario-201-Pact-World-Warriors">Starfinder Society #2-01: Pact World Warriors</a> or her time on the Pungeon Crawl Starfinder stream. With the recent personnel shuffle, our team was down a developer, and we looked for some extra assistance. Jenny stepped in and took on some freelance development work for us. She was responsible for a lot of the development work on <i>Descent into Verdant Shadow</i>. Jenny’s help ensured we could stay on top of other duties, like the approaching Additional Resources update and the addition of pregenerated characters for the new <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0206c?Starfinder-Character-Operations-Manual">Starfinder Character Operations Manual</a> classes. So, I wanted to take this opportunity to thank Jenny for her work on one of this month’s scenarios and her upcoming development work on one of December’s scenarios!</p> 
                <p>That brings us to the end of the November previews. Check back in tomorrow for a peek at what is to come with Pathfinder Society in November. Or if space is your cup of tea, come back next month when we venture to the mysterious world of Wealdriad and then into the very depths of the Lorespire Complex for our first Tier 9–12 scenario!</p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description">Wednesday always means New Comic Day, when comics fans like me swarm to the racks to find the newest releases. It’s been a while since we released a new Pathfinder comic with our friends at Dynamite (more on that soon—we’re working on something really special), but we thought the approaching holiday season was a good opportunity to team up with Humble Bundle to bring you a huge selection of Pathfinder comics at the best price of all: whatever you feel like paying!</p> 
                <p>The brand new <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/books/pathfinder-comics-cache-books?view=kVBbLwTgZo4q">Pathfinder Comics Cache</a> brings you SEVEN different Pathfinder comics storylines, from the very first issue ever printed to crossovers with Red Sonja and John Carter of Mars to an anthology of unforgettable goblin stories. If you’ve ever wanted to read the thrilling exploits and origins of the Pathfinder iconic characters, now is your best chance to jump on board.</p> 
                <p>BUT THAT’S NOT ALL! We’ve matched Dynamite’s generous offering with a bundle of amazing Pathfinder First Edition rulebooks and adventures that make perfect companions for the comic book action! Set out on a lifetime of adventure with the <i>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</i>, stock up on fabulous gear with <i>Ultimate Equipment</i>, or populate your comics-inspired dungeons with the critters from <i>Bestiary 1</i>, <i>Bestiary 2</i>, and <i>Bestiary 3</i>!</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/112019_HumbleBundle.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/112019_HumbleBundle_500.png"></a> 
                </div> 
                <p>The <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/books/pathfinder-comics-cache-books?view=kVBbLwTgZo4q">Pathfinder Comics Cache</a> also includes Pathfinder Director of Game Design Jason Bulmahn’s Price of Immortality adventure module trilogy, featuring the original Pathfinder First Edition starting dungeon, <i>Crypt of the Everflame</i>! This adventure series, starring Jason’s favorite villain, the false god Razmir, is the thematic basis for a great deal of Jason’s liveplay sessions over the last year, from <a href="https://paizo.com/knightsofeverflame">Knights of the Everflame</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOHNx3GvTFbEOBNu7-1MXQBI23PFYaz2Y">Oblivion Oath</a> to the Glass Cannon Network’s hilarious <a href="glasscannonpodcast.com/the-pathfinder-playtest-parts-1-and-2/">Pathfinder Second Edition Playtest</a>. The adventures are a great way to get some extra insight into Jason’s madness. All Hail the Living God!</p> 
                <p>The <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/books/pathfinder-comics-cache-books?view=kVBbLwTgZo4q">Pathfinder Comics Cache</a> gives you the chance to decide your price for more than $275 worth of awesome comics and Pathfinder First Edition rulebooks and adventures! Portions of proceeds from the effort go to benefit <a href="http://www.ranchoobiwan.org/about/mission/">Rancho Obi-Wan</a>, a California Nonprofit that serves the public through the collection, conservation, exhibition and interpretation of Star Wars memorabilia and artifacts, using the collection to provide meaningful educational, aesthetic, intellectual and cultural experiences for a wide array of audiences, including school tours of the largest Star Wars collection in the world.</p> 
                <p>BUT WAIT, THERE’S MORE!</p> 
                <p>Keep your eyes on Humble Bundle in December as well, as we’ve got a huge Pathfinder First Edition bundle coming in the very near future. We’ve included comics and rulebooks in several past bundles, but next month’s effort will provide a huge number of never-before-bundled game books for anyone looking to master the lore of the Age of Lost Omens. Keep watching this space for more details, and get thee to the (virtual) comic shop! The <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/books/pathfinder-comics-cache-books?view=kVBbLwTgZo4q">Pathfinder Comics Cache</a> awaits!</p> 
                <p>EXCELSIOR!</p>

                <p itemprop="description">I want to apologize for the lack of blogs the past two weeks. I returned from Gamehole Con in Madison and critically failed my fort save, succumbing to con crud of epic proportions. My week enforced vacation provided much needed rest but resulted in some tasks not getting done. On a positive note, that means two days of organized play blogs this week, as we have this one today and our scenario reviews tomorrow.</p> 
                <p>One of the tasks to sort out on my return involved confusion on how we release Pathfinder Adventure Card Society scenarios. We decided to streamline our workflow and move releases to the last Wednesday of the month, alongside our Pathfinder Society and Starfinder Society scenarios. To get on this schedule, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq021d5?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Society-63-Fortress-of-Ruin">Pathfinder Adventure Card Society #6-3: Fortress of Ruin</a>, releases tomorrow, November 20th. An story independent adventure, <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq021w2?PACS-Adventure-1-A-Night-at-Bloodthorne-Manor">Pathfinder Adventure Card Society #1: A Night in Bloodthorne Manor</a>, releases December 18th, just in time to play it over the holiday season. The next installment in the Year of Rotting Ruin debuts end of February 2020 and we will be on a mostly every other month schedule from that point. We hope having a regular release cycle will assist event organizers and gaming groups in scheduling their games.</p> 
                <p>Last, but definitely not least, the organized play team hired a new developer, which brings us back up to pre-Gen Con strength! It gives us great pleasure to have <b>James Case</b> join our team. James comes to us from the Paizo editing department, where he’s wielded his skill with words nimbly for some time. We look forward to utilizing his word skills, excel mastery, and ideas in organized play land. Plans are for James to focus on Pathfinder Society, working with Michael Sayre, but you know the saying about the best laid plans. Yeah, that one. So, who knows what we will wind up with! You can learn more about the newest organized play developer in a self-authored blog coming the second Wednesday of December.</p> 
                <p>So without further ado, I turn to our regular features.</p> 
                <h2>Campaign Coins</h2> 
                <p>While at PaizoCon Asia-Pacific, two individuals received campaign coins in recognition for their ongoing contributions to our organized play programs. Both currently volunteer as Venture-Captains for their cities. In addition, they travel extensively as GMs and participate in the online community. Please take a moment to congratulate the following community members for their efforts on behalf of our gaming community and congratulate them on receiving new Org Play numbers!</p>

                <h2>Stars</h2> 
                <p>While the launch of Pathfinder (second edition) means less games run under the first edition rules, we still had a couple GMs complete the requirements earn their 5th GM star. To achieve this milestone, they ran 150 games, including 50 unique scenarios and 10 special scenarios, as well as ran a game for a venture-captain. A conservative estimate of time needed to reach 5-stars is 650 hours! Thank you to the GMs listed below for their time and service on behalf of the Pathfinder Society! We appreciate you very much. Huzzah on their achievement!</p>

                <h2>Novas &amp; Glyphs</h2> 
                <p>Lots of Paizo.com updates and new tools, so moving one step closer to getting Nova’s automated. Until then, please email evaluation submissions to <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a> for collation.</p> 
                <p>Once we get the right graphics updated, you’ll see glyphs appearing on the website. Unfortunately, I’m not a web programmer, so our request is reliant on tech help, and they’ve been busy with quite a few updates (you may have seen a few of them). We will get this resolved shortly and update the organized play ID card to reflect all three programs.</p> 
                <h2>Convention Listing</h2> 
                <p>Though the year draws to a close, convention season hasn’t wrapped up! You can play in Society games at any of the conventions listed below! The list includes all events requesting support as of 15 November. If you see one missing, ping the organizer and have them submit a request for support or have them email me at organizedplay@paizo.com to discuss their event. All of the conventions on the list maintain some type of web presence, be it website, social media page, or Warhorn listing, so if you are interested in attending in either capacity, check out their websites or contact the local venture-officer for more information!</p>

               <blockquote> 
                <p itemprop="description"><i>Today is going to be a good day.</i></p> 
                <p>That’s what Major Ramalakesh remembered telling himself this morning while he was putting on his uniform. Now he wasn’t so sure. He looked up at the starry sky above Absalom Station’s Eye, squinting in the harsh light of the yellow sun, and thought of the relentless hard vacuum beyond the thin layer of polycarbon plate. The transparent dome looked so fragile. One crack, one tiny hole in that flimsy bubble, and everyone and everything in the Eye would die horribly and without honor in a matter of seconds. And the Pact Worlders placed their government here, without even a hint of defensive fortifications. Ramalakesh couldn’t comprehend it. It made him uneasy.</p> 
                <p>He lowered his gaze and tried to not to think about the dome overhead. He had been so excited this morning! This was his first day of leave since arriving from the Veskarium a week ago, and his first opportunity to really explore Absalom Station. It was what he had always dreamed of. This is why he had joined the Imperial Diplomatic Corps. This is why he had fought so hard to be assigned to the Veskarium’s diplomatic mission to the Pact Worlds. What better place to experience the galaxy’s wealth of alien cultures than the very hub of the Pact Worlds?</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/1114719_TheSameStars.jpg"><img style="max-width:100%" src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/1114719_TheSameStars.jpg" alt="The open-air streets of Absalom Station bustle with diverse crowds of alien beings."></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Leon Tukker</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>So why did he feel so anxious? Why was he on edge? It wasn’t just the bubble, or the days that were four hours shorter than on Vesk Prime. It was something more, something unexpected. As Ramalakesh walked among the government buildings and gardens of Parkside, he studied the people passing by and marveled again at the sheer diversity of alien life all around him. Humans, kasathas, lashuntas, barathus, ryphorians, and countless others. There were so many of them, speaking so many different languages, it was almost overwhelming.</p> 
                <p>But why would that unsettle him? Ramalakesh was only a junior attaché on his first assignment outside the Veskarium, but this wasn’t his first encounter with alien species. The Veskarium was a multicultural society, especially on Vesk Prime. He had interacted with ijtikris, pahtras, skittermanders, and even a few Pact Worlders—humans and lashuntas, mostly—before, with no problems whatsoever. They were always accommodating, almost even subservient at times. They knew their role and position in society, just as they recognized his.</p> 
                <p>Slowly, it dawned on him what was so different here. Why he felt so uneasy, so out place. He was vesk, and back home in the Veskarium he enjoyed an entitlement he had never lived without.</p> 
                <p>In the corridors and streets of Absalom Station, people still gave him a wide berth, but that was only because of his imposing physical presence. Not because he was vesk. There wasn’t the automatic, deferential respect he was used to from non-vesk. Instead, there was indifference. The Pact Worlders didn’t care that he was vesk. He was surrounded by a multitude of people, different species from worlds scattered across the galaxy, and he was just one more alien, a single drop of water in a vast galactic ocean. He looked around and couldn’t find any other vesk in sight. At home on Vesk Prime, they thronged the streets, but here on Absalom Station, vesk were a distinct minority. Ramalakesh suddenly felt very alone, as if he was on the front line of a battle and his all comrades had suddenly deserted him, abandoning him to face the enemy alone. And a hot anger began to stir in his belly.</p> 
                <p>Lost in his thoughts and not paying attention to his surroundings, Ramalakesh bumped hard into an android passing by. The android spun around and gave him a rough shove.</p> 
                <p>“Watch where you’re going next time, lizard,” the android said, the circuitry tattoos on their expressionless face glowing brightly.</p> 
                <p><i>Did they just call me lizard</i>? Ramalakesh thought incredulously. In an instant, a predatory rage dropped over him at the affront. Instinctively, Ramalakesh bared his teeth and growled in the back of his throat. His heart sung in exhilaration, and he could hear the war-songs of his ancestors ringing in his ears. His clawed hand flashed to the dueling sword at his waist. This android would learn to respect their betters.</p> 
                <p>The android’s face was unchanged as they flipped aside their cloak, revealing a disintegrator pistol pointed right at the vesk’s midsection.</p> 
                <p>“Back off, repto. I’d hate to have to melt a hole right through those pretty little scales of yours.” Somehow, the android’s monotone voice made them sound even more threatening.</p> 
                <p>Ramalakesh knew that if he got into a fight here in public, he risked creating a diplomatic incident. His career would be ruined. He would be cashiered and sent back to the Veskarium in dishonor. His heart was pounding in his chest, but whether from bloodlust or fear, he didn’t know. There was only one thing to do. Breathing heavily, Ramalakesh held up his hands and lowered his head. When he wasn’t immediately shot, he turned and fled into the crowd.</p> 
                <p>Everything around him was a blur, a clashing cacophony of lights, colors, and noises. But it was all wrong. The light was wrong, the smells were wrong, the people were wrong, and the babble of their languages was incomprehensible. Ramalakesh understood now why so many of his compatriots preferred to stay in the Vesk Quarter, where the blue lighting felt more natural, where the smell of spiced talakka meat filled the air, where they could hear and speak their native tongue, comfortably surrounded by their own people. A place where everything was in order, everyone followed a regimented routine, just the way things were supposed to be. It wasn’t home, but it was the only place on this station that felt even close. Ramalakesh hurried through Parkside, head down, retreating to the safety of the Vesk Quarter.</p> 
                <p>Just as Ramalakesh was nearing the exit from the Eye that led to the arm of the station that held the Vesk Quarter, a jumpsuited ysoki walked into his legs, halting them both in their tracks. The small ratfolk had been talking animatedly to his companion and hadn’t noticed the vesk coming toward him.</p> 
                <p>“Whoa! You’re a big one, aren’t you?” the ysoki said, looking up. Without thinking, Ramalakesh showed his teeth and growled, glaring down at the ysoki. He wasn’t sure he’d be able to hold back this time. The ysoki’s eyes widened and he scrambled backward, hand scrabbling toward the flame pistol on his belt.</p> 
                <p>“You walked right into him, Quig,” said the ysoki’s companion, a human female. “Now apologize to the nice vesk.”</p> 
                <p>“Hey, hey, all right,” the ysoki said, raising both hands. “Sorry, my friend. Wasn’t watching where I was going. My mistake.”</p> 
                <p>Ramalakesh took a deep breath and gritted his teeth, trying to will away his anger, his frustration, his doubt. The human woman gazed at him with thoughtful, appraising eyes.</p> 
                <p>“New here?” she asked. Her smile was friendly and genuine. “Welcome to Absalom Station. Don’t worry. You’ll get used to it. And if you haven’t checked out Golotra’s in the Freemarkets yet, you should! She has the best grilled talakka steaks on the station. Trust me.” She winked at him.</p> 
                <p>“Have a nice evening.” The human woman gave a wave that was half salute, put her hand on the ysoki’s shoulder, and the two of them walked past, disappearing into the crowd.</p> 
                <p>As he turned to watch them go, Ramalakesh suddenly realized he felt more at ease. Maybe Absalom Station and the Pact Worlders weren’t so bad, after all. He would retreat—briefly—to the Vesk Quarter and regroup in the comfort of his bunk in the diplomatic barracks. And in the morning, after a good night’s rest, he would again be ready for battle, of a sort. Ramalakesh would do his duty to the empire and conquer Absalom Station. He would make it a part of him, and himself a part of it, and maybe his efforts would help bring the peoples of the Veskarium and the Pact Worlds just a tiny bit closer together in true friendship.</p> 
                <p>Major Ramalakesh looked up at the stars overhead, the same stars that shone above Vesk Prime. He could almost smell spiced talakka in the air. He straightened his spine and smiled. </p> 
                <p>Tomorrow was going to be a good day.</p>

                <p>First, we introduced the new iconic characters in our <i>Meet The Iconics</i> series. Subsequently, in our <i>Iconic Encounters</i> web-based flash fiction series, we received a glimpse into the life and personality of each of them. Developer Jason Keely put <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgws?Meet-The-Iconics-Barsala">Barsala</a>, a.k.a. “Dr. B,” the new iconic biohacker centerstage. Then we saw Barsala test a hypothesis in <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgwy?Iconic-Encounter-The-Scientific-Method">The Scientific Method</a>. Managing Director Amanda Hamon manifested <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgwu?Meet-The-Iconics-Zemir">Zemir</a>, the iconic witchwarper. Later, she revealed more about Zemir in <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgx0?Iconic-Encounter-The-Reality-Next-Door">The Reality Next Door</a>. Lead Designer Joe Pasini shown the spotlight on <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgwt?Meet-The-Iconics-Velloro">Velloro</a>, the iconic vanguard. And then he showed Velloro in entropic action in <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgwz?Iconic-Encounter-A-Hail-Of-Bullets">A Hail Of Bullets</a>.</p> 
                <p>In <i>Starfinder Wednesday!</i> on our <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo">OfficialPaizo Twitch channel</a>, Social Media Producer Payton Smith got interactive with the new classes. Most of the Starfinder team, including Jason Keeley, Joe Pasini, Amanda Hamon, and Creative Director Rob McCreary, sat down together and—with the live assistance of chat— built a <a href="https://youtu.be/VXYy5n3AQAw">biohacker</a>, a <a href="https://youtu.be/CnogzS4Sv4Q">vanguard</a>, and a <a href="https://youtu.be/FhJ2y_1gvIQ">witchwarper</a>. All the <i>Starfinder Wednesday!</i> videos have been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOHNx3GvTFbEfyrfPBL_cF1kZt5jt8IDS">archived on YouTube</a> for you to watch now, with one possible exception.

                </div> 
                <p>Those of you who are familiar with Varian, whether from the Pathfinder Society, the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9s2e?Pathfinder-Tales-Character-Deck">Pathfinder Tales Character Deck</a>, <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5lk4h?A-Novel-Approach-to-Creating-the-Pathfinder">Keith’s previous blog post about that deck</a>, or from any of <a href="https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/fiction/tales/novels">Dave Gross’s novels featuring Varian,</a> will recognize that I might have, ahem, stretched the truth a bit in that last paragraph. If that sounds interesting to you, I can enthusiastically recommend any of those sources for more detail. For now, I’m going to dig a bit deeper into the design of Varian as a PACG character.</p> 
                <p>When the time came for us to put together a set of characters for Curse, we knew that we’d want to play up the connection between the characters and the city of Korvosa itself, so Varian went on the list early. In addition to being a cool and familiar character that hadn’t yet appeared in an Adventure Path, he’s a graduate of the Acadamae in Korvosa and he’s a noble with interesting connections to Cheliax, Asmodeus, and Desna. The early drafts of his character wanted to establish him as a wizard (mostly… more on that later), a bit of a fencer, and a well-connected man-about-town.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/110819_VarianCardFront.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/110819_VarianCardFront_500.jpeg" alt="Front face of the Varian character card showing skills for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game."></a> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/110819_VarianCardBack.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/110819_VarianCardBack_500.jpeg" alt="Back face of the Varian character card showing the Deck List for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game."></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Dashing, debonair, and potentially dangerous? Checks out.</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>Varian’s hardly a hulking, brutish sort (if that’s your thing, check his cohort Radovan), so we didn’t want him to rely on Strength, but we still wanted him to be capable in Melee. We were planning on pushing him toward Finesse-style weapons, so we counted on being able to give him a skill to help. This ended up as Acrobatics: Dexterity and Sword proficiency, which helps keep him true to Dave Gross’s original concept without too much card-text overhead. This approach also made him a good potential fit for—avoiding spoilers here—an option that comes up during the AP. As a “gentleman of means and connections,” we gave him a power that adds a bonus to efforts (his or others) wherever he could reasonably call on civilized aid. This melded nicely with the new traits we’d added to locations. So Varian can call for help in Urban locations, where his name, rank, manners, money, and/or general confidence can be put to use. Naturally enough, this makes Varian want to spend his time in those locations.</p> 
                <p>Since Varian is a wizard, he has a strong Arcane skill, but with his particular take on wizardry, we wanted him to feel distinct from Ezren or Darago during play. Since the Core Set was moving away from “if you have the Arcane skill” toward proficiency as the method to determine whether or not spells were used as if prepared from a book or as one-shot scrolls, we could simply give him proficiency with Arcane to keep the spells after using them. To create the “riffle scrolls” effect (see <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy8mfs"><i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Magic</i></a> for more details) that allows Varian to avoid the debilitating nausea that besets him when casting spells, we gave him an unusual power: Unlike Seoni who automatically succeeds at recharging Arcane spells, or Ezren who is very likely to succeed, Varian automatically <i>fails</i>. This gets those boons into his discard pile where his next character power lets him pull them to the bottom of his deck.</p> 
                <p>Finally, we come to Varian’s fourth character power, one that requires a feat. This power lets him draw some cards and then recharge the same number of cards, so he stays at the same number of cards in hand, but he gets to choose which he keeps and which he stores away for later. All by itself, this filtering power is useful on both ends: it can help you get a key card that’s hiding in your deck, and it can also let you save cards that are good but not yet needed, or not safe sitting in your hand. This power is a bit more mechanical than some others; to me, it generally represents Varian’s resourcefulness, and it also combines with his riffle scrolls power to help him manage which spells he wants now versus which spells he wants later. This gets us to the not-so-secret direction that I wanted for Varian: deck control. It would take too long to explain, so I’ll try to sum up. You see, it’s all Paizo’s fault. To be more specific: it’s <i>PaizoCon’s</i> fault. </p> 
                <p>Late in the wee hours one PaizoCon night, Keith and I were watching and playing an early Core playtest. Who did which has been lost to sleeplessness, but what’s important here is that someone was playing an Arcane caster, and they were playing it by <i>counting their deck</i>.</p> 
                <p>Since the early days of PACG, we’ve seen people dedicate a lot of attention to managing their deck. While most Divine casters tend to heal themselves to victory—<a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo5li9y?Pauls-Best-Character-Ever-Lini">hi, Paul!</a>—other early characters like Valeros and Sajan also get in on the recharging game, especially when combined with a little judicious deck thinning.</p> 
                <p>Deck thinning, for those who don’t already know, is the process of specifically (and, hopefully, <i>carefully</i>) removing cards from your deck so that it’s more likely to produce the cards you really want. Valeros can thin his deck to his favorite weapons (or those most appropriate to the current scenario) and then make repeated use of his power to recharge them. If Sajan can get rid of his items and allies, then his deck is focused down to a big pile o’ blessings, which he can recharge for big hits. The downside of this approach is the danger. In addition to the utility of the specific cards you give up, you also have to sacrifice your “hit point buffer” to get there. For example, when <i>Rise the Runelords</i> Sajan’s deck is thinned down to his 10 blessings, he’s very strong at combat checks, but if he’s forced to discard 4 of them to damage, suddenly those boons he “got out of the way” would be very helpful to have around.</p> 
                <p>Even people who don’t push things quite so far can derive fun and benefit from managing what cards they recharge and when. This sort of deck manipulation is especially common among characters like Ezren and Seoni who cast a lot of spells, and usually get to recharge them. What I saw that night/morning at PaizoCon was someone who wasn’t just thinning their deck; they were working to set it up, ordering and recharging cards to the bottom to try to plan their future draws, setting themselves up to be ready for the future, for other people’s turns and their own. While this sort of play isn’t for everyone, both that player and the rest of the table seemed to be enjoying themselves. I always enjoy watching people really get into the game, whether it be the story, characters, theme, mechanics, or anything else. With Varian, I was trying to build a character for this sort of player. For the person who shuffles their deck, draws their starting hand, and then proceeds to exert order over the chaos of the game, choosing what to recharge, when, and in what order. For the person that knows when they want to be healed, and especially when they don’t want to be healed, because they know when the card they want is coming up, and they don’t want you messing with their order. I’ll say it again: it’s not for everyone, but in the right hands, it’s a beautiful thing.</p>

                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Sarcastic, stealthy, and sometimes savage? Checks out.</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>As Varian well knows, it’s always good to have friends. Also: companions, suitors, contacts, servants, agents, employees, and factotums. In this case, Varian has his personal “bodyguard” Radovan Virholt, and he’s quite lucky to do so. Radovan will stick around Varian to protect him from harm, and while he’s around, the two of them can be quite effective at solving “problems,” including problems you might not expect to be solved by a gentleman fencer. When Radovan does have to temporarily deal with a dangerous situation, Varian’s ability to draw and recharge will help get Radovan back by Varian’s side.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/110819_VarianAcadamaeGraduate.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/110819_VarianAcadamaeGraduate_500.jpeg" alt="Role card of Varian, Acadamae Graduate, showing Powers for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game."></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">The school clubs are both better and worse than you’d expect.</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>When Varian gains a role card, one option is to lean into his studies as an Acadamae Graduate. This lets him get even more benefit “around town” from his contacts that are interested in the Arcane arts. He can also filter cards to the top or bottom of his deck for even more control. Finally, his time at the Acadamae lets him call on his studies of magic and the Harrow, both to get out of unusual situations (using Arcane instead of another skill), and also to dig deep for a crucial spell in a moment of need.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/110819_VarianScionOfCheliax.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/110819_VarianScionOfCheliax_500.jpeg" alt="Role card of Varian, Scion of Cheliax, showing Powers for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game."></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">“Pick your poison” isn’t always meant so literally.</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>Varian’s other option in <i>Curse of the Crimson Throne</i> leans into his political, diplomatic, and noble connections, as well as his fencing studies *cough* <i>spoilers avoided</i> *cough*. Always one to make friends and (try to) influence people, Varian can now make even greater use of his allies, both their inherent abilities and for “favors.” He can also get flashy with his rapier (or, I suppose, other, less <i>gentlemanly</i> weapons) to good effect. One of the powers represents some lessons that we think he might have picked up from his friend Radovan (I’ll bet you can guess which one!), or perhaps just the influence of his officious dedication to his official religion. Finally, neither last (on his role card) nor least (for my not-so-secret intentions), his “resourcefulness” ability can be extended to a large degree, especially late in the Adventure Path. Put another way, even if “deckmaster” isn’t your thing, I’ll bet you can find ways to enjoy drawing essentially a second full hand at the start of each turn, then putting a fistful of cards back for later, and in the order you think you might want them.</p> 
                <p>For those of you who might be looking to try out Varian for the first time, we’ve put together a set of deck suggestions for Varian using cards from the <i>Curse of the Crimson Throne Adventure Path</i>.</p> 
                <ul> 
                 <li><b>Weapon</b>: Scimitar </li>
                 <li><b>Spells</b>: Acid Burst, False Life, Infernal Healing, 2 others</li> 
                 <li><b>Item</b>: Spellbook, 2 others</li> 
                 <li><b>Ally</b>: Acadamae Student, 2 others</li> 
                 <li><b>Blessing</b>: any 3</li> 
                </ul> 
                <p>That’s it for now; I hope you enjoyed this look behind the curtain at Varian. If you’d like more or less of this sort of thing, please do let us know in the comments. Thanks!</p>

            <p itemprop="description">We can learn much from the wisdom of the divine, but we can learn as much from their actions. The truly faithful understand that not even the gods themselves are infallible, and that words and promises do not always suffice. Those among us who see no fault in the gods are worse than zealots, worse than puppets. They taint the very idea of faith with their blind devotion. When a god makes a mistake, the results can be disastrous if their faithful do not understand the error. If they take that error as gospel, they are doomed to repeat the error and compound upon it again and again. And in so doing make the initial misstep into something more. In the worst of cases, these repeated mistakes can transcend to become the new order, and not even the gods themselves can turn them back.</p>

                <p itemprop="description">We can learn much from the wisdom of the divine, but we can learn as much from their actions. The truly faithful understand that not even the gods themselves are infallible, and that words and promises do not always suffice. Those among us who see no fault in the gods are worse than zealots, worse than puppets. They taint the very idea of faith with their blind devotion. When a god makes a mistake, the results can be disastrous if their faithful do not understand the error. If they take that error as gospel, they are doomed to repeat the error and compound upon it again and again. And in so doing make the initial misstep into something more. In the worst of cases, these repeated mistakes can transcend to become the new order, and not even the gods themselves can turn them back.</p> 
                <p>Iomedae knows this well, for she was, not so long ago, among those who worshiped the gods herself.</p> 
                <p>Before her Ascension, Iomedae worshiped Arazni, the herald of the god of humanity, Aroden. When Arazni was defeated during the Shining Crusade, Iomedae turned her faith to Aroden. That Iomedae herself chose the path of a paladin was an indication of the strength of her convictions, for Arazni did not particularly embody the strictures of law, nor did Aroden particularly promote acts of goodness. But Iomedae saw the devotion to tradition and honor in Arazni’s deeds and could sense the underlying kindness and generosity in Aroden’s acts even if he didn’t notice them himself.</p> 
                <p>Even after she ascended to divinity herself, she continued to serve as Aroden’s new herald, and when the god of humanity perished unexpectedly at the dawning of the Age of Lost Omens, Iomedae did not lose hope. In the decades to follow, Iomedae’s faith grew and she inherited Aroden’s mantle. And as her church grew, she spread her wisdom to those who would listen. She told her followers to avoid her faults. To watch and judge themselves when she would misstep, and to not take her errors as gospel. For even before Iomedae’s apotheosis, she had noted imperfections in the gods she venerated, and as a goddess herself she vowed to never encourage the same unwavering zeal. And as such, she commanded that those who would worship her learn not solely from her words, but from her actions.</p> 
                <p>First came her memorable clash with legendary Nakorshor’mond, a gluttonous monstrosity spawned and abandoned by Lamashtu. The glutton consumed members of her adventuring group, and Iomedae had to cut her companions free from otherwise eternal slumber from the fiend’s supernatural gullets.</p> 
                <p>Next was her defeat of the Pallid Sisters, a coven of Garundi witches who had been terrorizing the city of Senghor. Here, Iomedae found triumph without ever drawing her blade, achieving victory through the clever use of wordplay and diplomacy alone.</p> 
                <p>The last of these initial acts performed before the Shining Crusade was the defeat of Segruchen the Iron Gargoyle, who had proclaimed himself the King of the Barrowood. Iomedae’s griffon-mounted battle saw the so-called King metaphorically dethroned in mid-air.</p> 
                <p>It wasn’t long after the Iron Gargoyle’s fall that the Shining Crusade began, and Iomedae was at the forefront of the battle from the start. During the Second Battle of Encarthan, Iomedae’s legacy grew as she took command of a regiment of mortally wounded knights and held back a wave of wraiths long enough for reinforcements to arrive at dawn.</p>

                </div> 
                <p>Erum-Hel, the Lord of the Mohrgs, was her next great triumph during the crusade—Iomedae defeated him during the Battle of Three Sorrows. She wasn’t able to slay the powerful undead monster, but sent him whimpering back into the Darklands nonetheless, and in so doing struck a crippling blow against one of the Whispering Tyrant’s most notorious and feared generals.</p> 
                <p>Soon thereafter, the Whispering Tyrant struck back against Iomedae and shattered her magical sword. Yet Iomedae didn’t let this deter her, and she simply rebuilt it and continued the fight, for she knew that it was not her sword that gave her the power to stand against evil—it was only a tool in that pursuit.</p> 
                <p>A month after the Shining Crusade came to an end, Iomedae visited Absalom with several other veterans of the war. Her visit to the temple of Aroden drew more adoration for her own acts than for Aroden herself, but it was a month after she left that another miracle took place when her image appeared at the same shrine—an image that healed the needy and spurned the wicked… including one false priest of Aroden who had secretly conspired with the cult of Asmodeus to convert those of faltering faith. </p> 
                <p>Although the Shining Crusade had ended, many of those who had fought for Tar-Baphon remained behind. Since the war was over, Iomedae sought to redeem those who had lingered. Her greatest work during these days was the redemption of the graveknight known only as the Black Prince. With her forgiveness, he was able to repent for his evil, bringing an end to his undead state and allowing his soul to pass on for judgement.</p> 
                <p>Elsewhere in Ustalav, Iomedae heard of nine forlorn knights who had fallen from favor among the church during the crusade, only to go missing soon after their excommunication. She sought them out and freed them from the vampire-mage Basilov, using nine drops of her own blood as payment in ransom. She was forced to slay the vampire soon thereafter, but with the knights’ aid, she also secured their return to the church.</p> 
                <p>Iomedae’s rule over the city of Kantaria began soon thereafter, but only lasted for a year and a day, but she never intended to rule for long—just long enough to protect the city from sinister shapechangers so that a legitimate ruler could take the role.</p> 
                <p>Finally came her eleventh act—an act that would end her time as a human and begin her life as a goddess. Iomedae cast her cloak down over the pit surrounding the Starstone Cathedral, transforming the garment into a bridge upon which she could cross the chasm and enter the edifice to take the Test of the Starstone.</p> 
                <p>Today, the faithful refer to these eleven deeds as the Acts of Iomedae. Iomedae has made it clear that the lessons, not the specifics, are important, and to her faith’s credit the vast majority understand this. What tends to get lost in the excitement of worship and admiration, though, is the fact that Iomedae didn’t set out at the start of her acts to perform eleven heroic accomplishments. They were, in truth, attempts by Iomedae to learn from the failings of those she respected, be they family or friend or even one of the gods.</p>

               <p>James Jacobs is the Creative Director for Pathfinder. While he was there at the beginning of Golarion’s creation, many of the deities worshiped by that world’s heroes and villains had already existed for decades before. Goddesses and gods like Desna and Rovagug, Sarenrae and Abadar, Achaekek and Zon-Kuthon first established their faithful among PCs and NPCs alike in James’ home campaign in the late 80s and early 90s. Sharing them with the world as deities of the Pathfinder setting, seeing players and creators come to love and hate them (and in some cases cosplay as them), has been a career highlight.</p> 
               <p style="font-weight: bold; line-height: 14px">About the Windsong Testaments</p> 
               <p>On the northern reaches of Varisia’s Lost Coast stands Windsong Abbey, a forum for interfaith discussion tended by priests of nearly twenty faiths and led by a legacy of Masked Abbesses. At the dawn of the Age of Lost Omens, Windsong Abbey suffered as its faithful fought and fled, but today it has begun to recover. A new Masked Abbess guides a new flock within, and the <i>Windsong Testaments</i>—parables about the gods themselves—are once again being recorded within the abbey’s walls. Some of these Testaments are presented here as Golarion’s myths and fables. Some parts may be true. Other parts are certainly false. Which ones are which is left to the faithful to decide.</p>

                <p itemprop="description">Feeling overwhelmed by the wealth of new Starfinder <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgzl?Character-Operations-Manual-Preview-Race-Options">species</a> and <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgzt?Classing-Things-Up-With-Starfinders-Newest-Book">class</a> options in the new <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0206c?Starfinder-Character-Operations-Manual">Character Operations Manual</a>? Well, take a break and spend some downtime with me, and I’ll introduce you to a new system introduced in this very same book.</p> 
                <p>I love downtime—it’s the home of the montage and the “Meanwhile…”—and it lets you build those flavorful interrelational stories that bring motley crews together between their high-octane adventures. Downtime requires you to take at least one day off. You can still rest for 8 hours, but otherwise you can’t be out there beating up aliens and shooting down Corpse Fleet ships if you really want to focus on your downtime activities.</p> 
                <p>Let’s you and I hop in a starship and head to Near Space. With 3d6 days of travel ahead of us, we can try out some of the dozens of downtime activities covered by this system!</p> 
                <p>To start us off, why don’t you spend a few days using the <b>manage course</b> activity? If you succeed, you’ll shave some hours off our trip! I’ll use the <b>maintain readiness</b> activity in the meantime—if we’re interrupted by some combat in the Drift, we’ll get a bonus to our initiative.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/110719_SystemOfADowntime.png"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/110719_SystemOfADowntime_500.png" alt="Velloro, the Iconic Vanguard, sitting cross-legged playing a 2D hologram martial arts combat game with a console in his hands and a smile on his face."></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Illustration by Mirco Paganessi</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>After that, it’s time to <b>lounge</b>! I’ll probably watch some trivids and get some vidgaming done in the crew quarters, and you can head to the tech workshop and do some arts and crafts. The next day, we’ll both automatically get some temporary Hit Points and a +1 morale bonus to our first saving throw.</p> 
                <p>I suppose after that, we’d better get ready for action. We could individually <b>drill</b> specific skill tasks, potentially letting us take 10 on those tasks the next day (even under stress), or we could work together to <b>coordinate</b>, training together to gain bonuses on covering or harrying fire (or further bonuses if we spend multiple days).</p> 
                <p>And heck, once we reach our destination, we can keep the good (down)times going with activities like <b>build shelter</b>, <b>carouse</b>, <b>practice profession</b>, or <b>secure area</b>, all giving us specific benefits or bonuses, as we choose!</p> 
                <p>But we don’t have to do any of those; there are more than a dozen other options—grab <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq0206c?Starfinder-Character-Operations-Manual">the book</a> and let me know which you prefer!</p>

                <p>Welcome to the <i>Pathfinder Advanced Player’s Guide</i> playtest! In the document below, you’ll find four new classes set to be introduced in the <i>Advanced Player’s Guide</i> in July 2020, but before we can add them to the game, we need your help to ensure they are the best they can be! To do that, we need you to create characters using these classes and give them a try. We’re hoping that each of these new characters offers you a style of play that’s enjoyable, effective, and distinct from the currently available classes, allowing you to tell even richer stories with diverse experiences in all modes of play.</p> 
                <p>Curious about what these classes are all about? Here is a brief synopsis of each to get your character ideas flowing.</p> 
                <ul> 
                 <li>The <b>investigator</b> is a savvy, street-smart character who takes cases to uncover clues and solve mysteries. This class ties to parts of the game that aren’t covered in depth in the <i>Core Rulebook</i>, so the playtest will see if their approach to solving mysteries is satisfying, while keeping the rules for the game as a whole flexible.</li> 
                 <li>The <b>oracle</b> commands divine powers by drawing from universal concepts, casting powerful revelation spells that take a toll on their body and manifest as a double-edged curse. We want to make sure the curse effects are fun and engaging without disrupting the balance of the class compared to other characters. For the playtest, we’ve selected only a subset of mysteries, but there will be more in the final version.</li> 
                 <li>The <b>swashbuckler</b> is the flamboyant daredevil of the battlefield, tumbling through foes and entering a heightened state to deliver devastating finishing blows. We’ll be testing a system that encourages them to gain panache, a state of bombastic flair that lets them use more powerful abilities. The playtest version emphasizes new rules specific to the class so that we can playtest those thoroughly, but the final version might pick up some of the fighter’s weapon feats suited to dueling.</li> 
                 <li>The <b>witch</b> serves a mysterious patron entity, casting spells and hexes learned through a powerful familiar. This is the most flexible spellcasting class we’ve introduced, since it allows you to build your own path by selecting not only feats, but also lessons from your patron.

                <h2>How to Playtest</h2> 
                <p>The playtest will run until December 2nd, 2019. We’re looking for your feedback, comments, and criticisms regarding these classes, but we’re focusing our attention on feedback from play. Make new characters, use them as PCs or adversaries, and run a few game sessions or encounters incorporating them!</p> 
                <h3>What the Playtest Is, and What it Isn’t</h3> 
                <p>When playtesting these classes, remember that almost anything can change based on the results of the playtest! These are early iterations of the new classes; some abilities might be a bit extreme or stretch some assumptions of the game, and the best way to find out if we’ve gone too far (or in the wrong direction) is for us to deliver these classes into your hands. If you’re new and used to open betas on a video game where there’s mostly only small refinements, this will be a different experience. If you’re a veteran of the Pathfinder Playtest for the new edition of the game, you should note that because the playtest window is relatively short this time, we don’t expect to release any changes to these classes during the playtest itself, but your thoughts and feedback will still be vital in shaping the final versions of the classes.</p> 
                <h3>How Can You Help</h3> 
                <p>We’d like you to play these classes in a variety of levels and situations. If you’re looking for a published adventure to get some standardized feedback, we recommend trying out <i>Fall of Plaguestone</i>, which offers a stand-alone experience at some of the most commonly played levels of the game with some particularly challenging series of combats that can help put the classes through their paces.</p> 
                <p>Once you’ve had a chance to try the classes, you can submit your feedback in the following ways. <b>If you only have time for one form of feedback, we’d ask you to please take the survey.</b> It makes it easier for us to hear and apply your feedback, since it’s more structured and puts your responses directly at our fingertips. </p> 
                <ul> 
                 <li><b>Surveys:</b> Head to <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/APGClassSurvey">https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/APGClassSurvey</a> and <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/APGOpenResponse">https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/APGOpenResponse</a> to take surveys that will allow us to gather your responses. These surveys will be available starting Tuesday, November 12, 2019 and they will remain open until the end of the playtest.</li> 
                 <li><b>Forums:</b> On <b>paizo.com</b>, you’ll find a <a href="https://paizo.com/community/forums/pathfinder/second/advancedPlayersGuidePlaytest">general forum for discussion and announcements</a>, plus forums for each of the four new classes. When you post to the forums, look for existing threads on your topic before starting a new one. Remember that every poster is trying to make the game better for everyone, so please be polite and respectful.</li> 
                </ul> 
                <p><a href="https://paizo-images.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/image/download/PZO2105+Character+Playtest.pdf">You can find the downloads right here</a>. We’d like to thank you for participating in the <i>Advanced Player’s Guide</i> playtest, and we’re looking forward to seeing what you think and using your feedback to make these classes the best they can be!</p>

                <p itemprop="description">Paizo has been searching for better ways to deliver the kinds of apparel you want to see for both Starfinder and Pathfinder. For years, we’ve commissioned shirt designs, bringing them to PaizoCon and GenCon before selling them on paizo.com. Ensuring you get to pick the styles, sizes, and colors was a challenge that we haven’t been able to overcome...until now.</p> 
                <p>Today, we announce a new store on Amazon that has a plethora of apparel options we could only dream of offering directly. In addition to men’s, women’s, and youth sizes, you’ll also have the ability to choose:</p> 
                <p>Hoodies&amp; Sweatshirts<br>Long Sleeve T-shirts<br>Raglan Baseball Tee<br>Tank Top<br>T-shirts &amp; Premium Tees<br>Women’s V-neck T-shirts<br>Zip Hoodie</p> 
                <p><b>What’s the Difference Between T-shirts and Premium Tees?</b> The premium shirts have a slimmer fit than regular t-shirts and tend to have a more buttery feel to the cotton. </p> 
                <p><b>Are these cotton shirts?</b> Yes, but the amount depends on style and color. Solid colors tend to have more cotton, while heather tends to have less. This can vary quite a bit, so make sure to check the materials after you’ve chosen your style and color and adjust your size if needed to account for some shrinking.</p> 
                <p>Each style has up to 10 different color options (just click the See Buying Options to see them).</p>

                <p>Throughout this adventure, I encourage you to use the Harrows wildcard Harrow of Shields for additional flavor and challenge. If you’re on the fence about this extra challenge, consider using the <a href="https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgxd?Adventure-Time-Edge-of-Anarchy">Base suggestion from the previous Adventure Time blog</a>, or only apply Harrow of Shields when you have at least 3 cards in your discards (ensuring that <i>heal</i> effects will always provide some value).</p>

                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Time to really appreciate the Fortitude skill.</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>Let’s talk a little bit about the scourge Plagued. Nobody wants to be plagued. And as soon as someone is, nobody wants to hang out with them. Or suddenly everyone is plagued. It won’t kill your character quickly, but you’ll want to remove the scourge as soon as possible. The best ways to do so are to play your harrow, which lets you remove a scourge this adventure, or to go to the Base. Otherwise, you might want to stock up on boons like Antiplague, Balmberry, Remove Disease, Plague Mask, or Soothing Word.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/110119_MonsterTube.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/110119_MonsterTube_500.jpeg" alt="Image of a vat of diseased liquid with a disease daemon pickling in it for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game."></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Just a vat of diseased liquid with a disease daemon pickling in it. Like you do.</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>Every scenario in Seven Days to the Grave has its splash of plague to toss around. As long as you’re careful around wererats and plague zombies, though, you’ll mostly be okay. (The final scenario has a bit more than a splash, though. More like a deluge, or a particularly unhealthy bath. More about that later, though.)</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/110119_PlagueShip.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/110119_PlagueShip_500.jpeg" alt="Image of a ship with tattered sails at night at port for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game."></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">This isn’t the kind of ship that brings <i>good</i> things to town.</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>Before playing scenario 2A: Rats and the Sinking Ship, <a href="https://paizo.com/paizo/faq/v5748nrupch3h#v5748eaidgsil">please observe its FAQ.</a></p> 
                <p>When disease suddenly breaks out in Korvosa, there’s a rush to find out how. And there’s an even more intense rush to blame just about anyone and take advantage of the chaos for personal benefit. (Sometimes Korvosa is a little too realistic.) In scenario 2A, the finger-pointing has settled on a gang of wererats. After spending some time exploring the back alleys and sewers of Old Town, you determine they have nothing to do with it, but their dictator Girrigz does have plans to take advantage of the chaos. Once you deal with him, the wererats are happy to be helpful members of society and point you toward a sunken ship that might’ve brought the disease to town. It’s guarded by a sea hag druid and her (lone) shark, but not for long!</p> 
                <p>To increase the difficulty of this scenario, I’d suggest the Perils wildcards Desperate and Impoverished to evoke the sudden exhaustion of supplies and closing up of the town. The Onslaughts wildcard Wearisome is also solid, given how much swimming and sewer spelunking the characters need to do.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/110119_ZombieParty.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/110119_ZombieParty_500.jpeg" alt="Image of Harsk, the iconic dwarven ranger, and Seelah, the iconic human paladin, fighting a zombie horde for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game."></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Nobody told me it was a Bring Your Own Zombie party!</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>In scenario 2B: The Life of the Party, you continue your search for clues started in the previous scenario, stumbling into the “undead everywhere” part of the adventure. In addition to some opportunistic vampire spawn, the highlight of the scenario is a nod to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Masque_of_the_Red_Death">“The Masque of the Red Death.”</a> Worried about plague, some nobles have cheerfully shut themselves up in a manor house with a bunch of supplies, intending to have a long party while waiting out the trouble. That lasts right up until Jolistina Susperio, apprentice to the town’s favorite necromancer-slash-serial-killer Rolth Lamm (you raided his lair for body parts back in scenario 1C: The Dead Warrens), crashes the party... and turns everyone into zombies. Then she restarts the party, complete with costumed zombie dancing! Sanity is not one of Jolistina’s strengths.</p> 
                <p>The Onslaughts wildcard Monstrous works well with the scenario’s closing rules as well as the selection of level 2 monsters in Curse. For Legendary mode, I’d suggest the Perils wildcard Deadly to amplify those Plague Zombies, or the Perils wildcard Unhallowed to suit the rampant necromancy. <i>[Editor note: “Suit.” I see what you did there.]</i></p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/110119_CotCT.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/110119_CotCT_500.jpeg" alt="Cover of the Curse of the Crimson Throne Adventure Path featuring a queen standing before her throne with armored guards for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game."></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">This looks not at all suspicious.</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>In the RPG, right up until this point, it can be pretty unclear if the Queen is doing anything wrong. In fact, in one of my groups, one player loved the Queen so much she wanted to become a Gray Maiden. Thankfully, the party found out that’d be a bad idea before she got too far. The cover of the hardcover edition does make it a little more likely for the players to suspect her from the start, though.</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/110119_PlagueDoctor.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/110119_PlagueDoctor_500.jpeg" alt="Image of a Queen’s Physician in long coat, hat, long-nosed plague mask holding a vaporous beaker for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game."></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">These Queen’s Physicians also seem not at all suspicious.</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>Still, in scenario 2C: The Queen’s Hospitality, you have plenty of reason to want to sneak and talk your way past as many of the Gray Maidens and Queen’s Physicians as you can. (Along those lines, my wife’s character had a long-lost sister she’d been trying to track down that I’d made into a Gray Maiden, figuring it would lead to a great reveal. I underestimated the ability of players to foil any plan, though: Through a combination of well-planned and lucky acrobatics, stealth, and timing, she managed to miss interacting with her sister by literal inches. Oops.)</p> 
                <p>If you have the right skills, this scenario isn’t all that difficult, so when adding wildcards, you may want to consider how much Diplomacy, Perception, and/or Stealth the group has. If you have those skills, I’d encourage the Perils wildcard Hostile to provide a little more danger and suspense. The Perils wildcard Confusing and Onslaughts wildcard Hazardous also feel appropriate for wading through the deception and betrayal. If your group is rarely pressed for time, I’d add an additional location (adding Storehouse to the list for 6 characters).</p> 
                <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/110119_GothPriestess.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/110119_GothPriestess_500.jpeg" alt="Image of Lady Andaisin, the head cultist of Urgathoa, with her two-handed scythe for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game."></a> 
                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">Lady Andaisin, the head cultist of Urgathoa, would like you to have a civil discussion with her scythe.</p> 
                </div> 
                <p>After you make it past all of the false trails laid by the Queen’s minions, in scenario 2D: The Cult of Urgathoa, you discover a fully-fledged temple to the goddess of the undead under the city. There you also discover a vampire scholar who helped craft the blood veil plague and is studying why some portion of the populace seems to be immune to it. And those previously mentioned vats where cultists are currently brewing a thousand gallons of “viscous, phlegm-like fluid of concentrated blood veil.” After you deal with the villain in charge of the temple (twice!), you’ll save the city from the plague!</p>

                 <p style="font-size: 13px;">All pretense of civility is out once an Aspect of Urgathoa shows up.</p>

                <p>If your group is good at cornering villains, adding the location Blood Pool is a solid option. The Perils wildcards Hostile and Unhallowed and the Onslaughts wildcard Withering are all good fits thematically and mechanically. Because of the risk of plague and this scenario’s villain powers, managing your discards and buried cards adds suspense and a fear of death that will make winning this chapter feel like a well-earned triumph.</p> 
                <p>That’s Seven Days to the Grave. I promise you won’t need to make nearly as many Constitution Fortitude checks ever again. Probably. <i>[Editor note: No promises!]</i></p>
