  \ <p>As we get closer to this year’s <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ldgk\">Grand\
  \ Convocation</a>, more and more news seems to be springing up. This week we’ve\
  \ received another update from Grandmaster Torch.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurb180\"\

  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n   </div> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>Esteemed Pathfinders,</p>\
  \ \n    <p>As the Convocation approaches, this year is becoming far more interesting;\
  \ yet more special guests have been added to the list of attendees. I’m still putting\
  \ together what the motives of these newcomers are, but I wanted to share what I’\
  ve found thus far.</p> \n    <p><b>Olaf Kvaran:</b> Junior Pathfinders on the grounds\
  \ of the Grand Lodge reported that Kvaran showed up at the peak of a furious torrential\
  \ downpour. Laden in thick Ulfen furs, this man spoke of an impending disaster before\
  \ being rushed to meet with Ambrus Valsin. Following that meeting, this overbearing\
  \ Ulfen warrior has been added to the roster for this year’s Convocation. What dire\
  \ prediction does he know that I do not?</p> \n    <p><b>Karla Gessner:</b> Never\
  \ before have I heard of such a pious and upstanding woman. Having studied in the\
  \ famed Seventh Church of Iomedae, Karla Gessner only recently completed her training.\
  \ Unlike most of her fellow students, this woman has remained in Absalom. After\
  \ several meetings with the head priest and Ollysta Zadrian, Gessner has somehow\
  \ managed to get her name on the guest list. An interesting turn of events!</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Alexander Bedard:</b> The influence of Andoran continues to spread,\
  \ as I see a member of the nation’s People’s Council has managed to secure a spot\
  \ at the Convocation. Alexander Bedard was formerly a worker of the port authority\
  \ in Augustana, and I have met him on only a handful of occasions. The man speaks\
  \ of nothing but his boats, but otherwise he understands the delicacies of balancing\
  \ personal power with Andoran’s so-called democracy. Could his presence be part\
  \ of a larger Andoren agenda?</p> \n    <p align=\"right\">Keep your ears open,<br>\
  \ Grandmaster Torch</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>A few more tales have been spun\
  \ by Pathfinder Larius Kaludju, and, while he insists that he won’t be able to attend\
  \ this year’s Convocation, it appears there’s plenty going on in Absalom to keep\
  \ aspiring and veteran Pathfinders alike occupied.</p> \n   <blockquote> \n    <p>Another\
  \ day, another mission.</p> \n    <p>Like any good Pathfinder, I’ve done my fair\
  \ share of work for the Blakros family. On my last stop through the fair city of\
  \ our Grand Lodge, I ended up playing a game of cards with a janitor in the depths\
  \ of the famed Blakros Museum. After a few hands, the man opened up and started\
  \ complaining that the vaults were overflowing and the museum was running out of\
  \ storage space! I couldn’t believe it, and I truly wonder where the family plans\
  \ on storing all their precious finds.</p> \n    <p>There’s also a juicy tidbit\
  \ floating around town that tunnel diggers have been commissioned by Lord Gyr to\
  \ start expanding the sewer systems. It’ll be nice to have some new sewer lines\
  \ in the city, as I’ve had enough encounters with kobolds, spiders, and worse in\
  \ these damned sewers!</p> \n    <p>Anyway, that’s about it for my tales. I’m off\
  \ on a new mission to the Mwangi Expanse, but before I ship out, I’ve got a meeting\
  \ with my old friend Urmas Sirola and his lovely wife, Venla. Kind of strange, considering\
  \ Venla’s been doing a lot of work with the Blakros as well. I’ve even heard a rumor\
  \ that she’s made her way into the family’s social circles and is helping them with\
  \ some of their new acquisitions.</p> \n    <p>Of course, you didn't hear any of\
  \ this from me.</p> \n    <p align=\"right\">Larius</p> \n   </blockquote> \n  \
