  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Monday, January 7, 2008</p> \n   <p>It's one thing to interact\
  \ with readers of <i><a href=\"/pathfinder\">Pathfinder</a></i> here on the internet,\
  \ be it via messageboards or chat rooms, but it's certainly no replacement for face-to-face\
  \ conversation. We're pretty sheltered here at Paizo, sequestered away in the not-large-enough\
  \ room we semi-affectionately refer to as \"The Pit,\" and they don't let us out\
  \ that often, with the notable exception of Gen Con.</p> \n   <p>That all changed\
  \ last month on December 19th, when Erik Mona, Wes Schneider, and myself got to\
  \ escape the office to visit a friendly local game storeâ€”Oroboro Games. Since they\
  \ don't let us out much, I had no idea that there was a cool game store like this\
  \ so close to the offices. We showed up at about 7:00 PM, and although it was only\
  \ supposed to go for about an hour, once you get Erik, Wes, and I talking about\
  \ Golarion, well... time does strange things. The event ended up going for nearly\
  \ three hours, and it was great fun! Particularly fun for me was talking to people\
  \ who were playing Rise of the Runelords, and finding out just how much those goblins\
  \ get hated. Poor little guys! They're just looking for things to burn and babies\
  \ to eat. Is that so wrong?</p> \n   <p>Anyway, here's a couple of pictures of the\
  \ event. If you look real close, I think you can see some art we haven't yet shown\
  \ off on the website for book covers! Thanks, by the way, to Joshua J. Frost and\
  \ Carolyn Mull for making the event happen in the first place!</p> \n   <p> James\
