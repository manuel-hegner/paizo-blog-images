  artist: "Michael Jaecks... Vadid and Nahk Preview Purloiners Mimics are asexual,\
    \ and reproduce via spores. When a mimic controls enough food and territory, it\
    \ undergoes an involuntary internal change called spatter-spawning, laying out\
    \ a large, thick glue-carpet of spore-rich protoplasm 30 or more feet in diameter.\
    \ Having marked the walls and floor of a particular cavern or ruin with this stinking\
    \ graffiti, it departs, never to return. Immature mimics bud out of the whitish\
    \ glue-carpet, forming multi-hued, chitin-plated plasmoids the size of housecats;\
    \ immediately ambulatory and capable of camouflage, these miniature mimics feed\
    \ upon the glue-carpet, each other, and those helpless scavengers attracted by\
    \ the stench and subsequently trapped by the glue. Look for the full article on\
    \ mimcs in Dungeon Denizens Revisited!"
