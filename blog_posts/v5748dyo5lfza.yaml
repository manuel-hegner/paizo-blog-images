  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p>Hello Pathfinders!</p> \n    <p><span\
  \ itemprop=\"description\">The Pathfinder community is rapidly growing, reaching\
  \ numbers in the hundreds of thousands, spread all over this great wide world. Each\
  \ month, we ask a member of our community to tell us a little bit about themselves.\
  \ We'll feature players, hobby shops, and anyone else helping to make Team Pathfinder\
  \ awesome!</span></p> \n    <p>This month, Thurston Hillman basks in the warm glow\
  \ of Paizo's adulation, as our way of saying thanks for all his hard work writing\
  \ scenarios and generally being awesome!</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <div class=\"\

  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>To preface; it was a cold Canadian Monday when my local\
  \ venture-officers told me to stop by the local game shop for their weekly game\
  \ of Pathfinder Society. I showed up, only to find that it was 'Thursty Night' and\
  \ they were running tables using only my Society scenariosâ€”what an awesome feeling!\
  \ Of course, when Jenny Bendel messaged me about 30 minutes after I left about being\
  \ 'Pathfinder of the Month', I figured I was in some crazy gamer dream world. As\
  \ it turns out, I wasn't in some weird delusion, and now, here I am standing beside\
  \ giants (well John Halpin at least, I can't comment on Steve's height).</p> \n\
  \     <p>Living in the cold northern lands of Winnipeg, I can't say when I got into\
  \ roleplaying games. I started with a copy of AD&amp;D Second Edition, which I ran\
  \ throughout high school. The roughest looking of my 'old gaming collection' would\
  \ be my stack of Ravenloft books, which I've kept to this day.</p> \n     <p>Later,\
  \ while living in a bachelor pad of gamers, I was running about eight games, all\
  \ of which were Pathfinder. During this time, I GM'd my first adventure path; successfully\
  \ running a group of players through the Second Darkness where they managed to avert\
  \ the end of the world with only a single surviving character... who may, or may\
  \ not have been facing down the BBEG and about 30 of their minions before a well-timed\
  \ fade to black.</p> \n     <p>As you may have gathered from my little introduction,\
  \ I also freelance for Paizo. I started in 2010 when I tossed in a Pathfinder Society\
  \ open call submission. A browbeating set of feedback later and I was writing for\
  \ Paizo! Since that first project, I've been involved in writing two convention\
  \ specials and three more scenarios for the Society. Somehow I tricked the Paizo\
  \ staff into letting me do more work for them, and you can see some of my handiwork\
  \ from monsters in the upcoming Mummy's Mask adventure path.</p> \n     <p>In 2011\
  \ I snuck out to my first GenCon, where I volunteered at the Pathfinder Society\
  \ room. It was there I started making my first real connections in the community;\
  \ sharing drinks and conversations with people like Liz Courts, Jason Bulmahn, Tim\
  \ Hitchcock, Mark Moreland, and many more. Following GenCon, I was able to visit\
  \ Seattle and the Paizo home office during the weekend of PAX Prime 2011. During\
  \ this visit, I managed to meet Erik Mona, after forcing him into the gaming room\
  \ when I had all the tables chanting 'Squealy Nord'. I also had the privilege of\
  \ sleeping on Kyle Elliot's couch.</p> \n     <p>Bah, there are too many people\
  \ and too many stories to tell. That's the great thing about being part of this\
  \ community, I've made friends from across the world, and I like to consider this\
  \ community more than just a game. It's a group of great people, and it's my pleasure\
  \ to interact with them.</p> \n     <p>Except that Jim Groves guy, he's still my\
  \ archenemy.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>If you'd like to nominate a Pathfinder\
  \ of the Month, or would like to be featured yourself, send a blog of 500 words\
  \ or less, along with a photo, to <a href=\"mailto:press@paizo.com\">press@paizo.com</a>.</p>\
