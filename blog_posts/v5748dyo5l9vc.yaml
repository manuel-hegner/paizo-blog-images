  \ \n   <h1>Open Call: Mappers Wanted!</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, January\
  \ 28, 2009</p> \n   <p>I'm on a crusade.</p> \n   <p>Writing adventures and sourcebooks\
  \ for RPGs is tough. It takes a lot of different skills; you have to be a good writer,\
  \ you have to be imaginative and creative, you have to be diligent and good with\
  \ deadlines and continuity, and you have to have a head for rules and math. Truth\
  \ be told, it's not all the skills you need to be a successful adventure or setting\
  \ designer. You also need to be able to draw maps.</p> \n   <p>Just as with the\
  \ words of a product, which are developed and edited before they ever see print,\
  \ the author's maps are rebuilt and redrawn by professional cartographers. Those\
  \ cartographers don't actually create the maps you see in adventures out of the\
  \ blue themselves—they need the author's rough draft as a starting point. And when\
  \ an author's rough draft is illegible or boring, you have problems similar to what\
  \ an editor might face when a manuscript arrives that's riddled with spelling errors,\
  \ bad stat blocks, unfinished sentences, and other problems. In cases where we get\
  \ in maps that are illegible, one of us at Paizo generally has to redraw the map\
  \ before we send it on to the cartographer.</p> \n   <p>Pictured here are four map\
  \ turnovers for different locations that Wes and I created for adventures we've\
  \ written for <i>Pathfinder</i> (spoiler warning to players: If you're playing in\
  \ Rise of the Runelords or Second Darkness, AVERT YOUR GAZE!). Going forward, I'm\
  \ looking at alternate ways to get excellent map turnovers—we've got a few unannounced\
  \ products that are pretty map heavy, and I'm considering farming out the maps as\
  \ separate freelance projects. But in order to do that, I need to find some people\
  \ who can draw cool maps.</p> \n   <p>So here's the open call part. If you're good\
  \ at drawing maps, and are interested in helping Paizo have awesome maps in its\
  \ products, I would love to see some of your maps. Look at the four sample maps\
  \ here and try to outdo them. While the sample maps are of cities, dungeons, and\
  \ wilderness locations (and while I'd love to see maps of all three locations from\
  \ you), I'm in particular looking for awesome city maps. Send in your map as an\
  \ email attachment to me at <a href=\"mailto:james.jacobs@paizo.com\">james.jacobs@paizo.com</a>.\
  \ The maps don't need to be particularly high resolution, but they should certainly\
  \ be legible. The subjects of the maps can be anything you want—and keep in mind\
  \ I'm not looking for actual finished, publishable-quality maps—if you're THAT skilled\
  \ at maps, you should probably send your cartography resume to our art directors!</p>\
  \ \n   <p>Try to keep your maps to one map per email, and try to limit your submissions\
  \ to, at most, one map per category (dungeon, wilderness, or city). I'll do my best\
  \ to give brief replies to folks' map turnovers as well, and in the end I hope to\
  \ have found a bunch of new folk who can draw great maps. Where this will lead in\
  \ the end... I'm not sure. It's kind of an experiment.</p> \n   <p>The deadline\
  \ for this Open Call is February 9th, 2009. I look forward to seeing what you can\
  \ do!</p> \n   <p>James Jacobs<br> <i>Pathfinder</i> Editor-in-Chief</p> \n  </blockquote>\
