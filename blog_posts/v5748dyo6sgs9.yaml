  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">“There. Yes. Those two.”\
  \ Excitement, wet and thick, curdled Chemurr’s voice. She coughed and swallowed\
  \ noisily, but she was too agitated to keep the phlegm worms from crawling back\
  \ up. Her swollen fingers clenched around Gaiter’s arm. “Come, boy.”</p> \n    \
  \ <p>Gaiter pulled back. He knew it was stupid, dangerous. You didn’t annoy Chemurr\
  \ ever, but especially not when she got like this. He hated the phlegm worms, though.\
  \ Hated them too much to be smart, sometimes.</p> \n     <p>“How—how do you know?”\
  \ He made the question tremulous, fearful, hoping Chemurr would be satisfied enough\
  \ with his terror that she wouldn’t demand more. It wasn’t a stretch. Gaiter really\
  \ <i>was</i> frightened half out of his mind. “Did the Great Master tell you so?”\
  </p> \n     <p>“The Great Master doesn’t have to tell me that, boy.” Chemurr’s grip\
  \ tightened with her scorn. Her fingers squelched against Gaiter’s bones. “I can\
  \ smell it on them. The stink of delusion. Thinking that what they do <i>matters.</i>”\
  \ Her nostrils flared, sniffing, and a phlegm worm dropped out.</p> \n     <p>Gaiter\
  \ flinched. He couldn’t help it. Nor could he help looking at the thing that squirmed\
  \ across the cobblestones, fat and segmented and slimy, its skin whorled with runes\
  \ that shimmered with greasy, unreal colors and made his eyes ache. He tore his\
  \ gaze away, hastily, his eyes burning with tears.</p> \n     <p>If the light had\
  \ been better, he knew, he’d have been able to see a pink tinge on his fingers as\
  \ he dashed those tears away. Blood. His eyes were filmed with it, just from a glimpse\
  \ of a phlegm worm. A longer look, and he might have gone blind. Mad. Worse.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>It didn’t bear thinking about. Trying to ignore the grub, Gaiter studied\
  \ the figures Chemurr had pointed out. There were two, cloaked and hooded despite\
  \ the warmth of Egorian’s summer night. They moved quickly, but with a burdened\
  \ caution that suggested they were carrying some fragile or heavy contraband beneath\
  \ those cloaks.</p> \n     <p>He couldn’t smell anything from them, but that wasn’\
  t a surprise. The hooded figures were fifty feet away, and Chemurr and Gaiter were\
  \ crowded into the recesses of a stinking, unlit alley, hidden by shadows and the\
  \ Great Master’s magic. All he could smell was stale urine, rotting fish, and Chemurr’\
  s thick breath, fouler than the rest.</p> \n     <p>The hooded figures had stopped.\
  \ The street around them was momentarily empty. Quickly, they tossed back their\
  \ cloaks and drew out… a covered bucket and… paintbrushes? Gaiter squinted and leaned\
  \ forward.</p> \n     <p>One of them pulled a collapsible ladder from under his\
  \ cloak, shimmying to the top and balancing with impressive dexterity as he painted\
  \ a pair of silvery-blue crossed swords over a banner displaying the red-circled\
  \ cross of Infernal Cheliax. The other held the paint bucket and dipped the brushes,\
  \ handing them up to her partner.</p> \n     <p>“Why, they’re rebels,” Gaiter blurted,\
  \ too astonished to keep the thought to himself. He didn’t recognize the mark, but\
  \ no one else would dare deface Imperial insignia. Rebels. In Egorian! Perhaps the\
  \ devilers’ control wasn’t as absolute as he’d believed.</p> \n     <p>“Rebels and\
  \ devils, devils and rebels,” Chemurr crooned, as if she could read Gaiter’s thoughts.\
  \ She gurgled a wet laugh, audibly swallowing another phlegm worm in the middle\
  \ of it. “Yes. That’s all anyone thinks about here. They chase each other round\
  \ and round, and everyone forgets about us. Just as the Great Master wants it. Oh—\
  here come the devils now.”</p> \n     <p>A Hellknight patrol had spotted the painters.\
  \ They shouted a warning, made unnecessary by the clatter of their heavy spiked\
  \ armor. As good as alarm bells, that armor. The rebels tossed their brushes aside,\
  \ leaving a final swipe of blue across the defaced banner, jumped down from the\
  \ ladder, and ran.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/071819_tolo_old_cheliax.jpg\"\

  \ \n     </div> \n     <p>The Hellknights hadn’t a prayer of catching the light-footed\
  \ vandals. Gaiter was astonished that they could run at all in that massive, spiked\
  \ plate, let alone so quickly, but even so they were falling behind by the second.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>They knew it too. One of the Hellknights blew a carved bone whistle.\
  \ The whistle was soundless, but the bone-prickling baying of hellhounds rang out\
  \ in response. Three of the infernal beasts came rushing to join their armored masters,\
  \ their fire-wreathed bodies swift and bright in Egorian’s dark night. They pursued\
  \ the fleeing rebels relentlessly, gaining ground as quickly as the Hellknights\
  \ had lost it.</p> \n     <p>“Now,” Chemurr hissed as soon as the Hellknights were\
  \ past their alley.</p> \n     <p>“Now?” Gaiter balked again. Twice in the same\
  \ night. He really was tempting fate, pushing back on Chemurr like this.</p> \n\
  \     <p>But the Hellknights were still in sight—they’d only have to turn around\
  \ to spot him—and he’d seen what the Chelaxians did to the Great Master’s servants.\
  \ Despite everything else Gaiter had seen, everything else he’d <i>done</i>, those\
  \ screams stayed with him. There was a reason they’d stayed out of Thrune lands\
  \ so long. The devilers could be as cruel as the Great Master himself, and their\
  \ questions were as sharp as their knives.</p> \n     <p><i>“Now.”</i> Chemurr’\
  s fingers tightened so hard on Gaiter’s arm that one of them burst, soaking his\
  \ sleeve with wriggling slime. “While the rebels and the devils are distracted with\
  \ each other. Or do you not wish to accomplish our Great Master’s work?”</p> \n\
  \     <p>Gaiter swallowed, nodded, and ran.</p> \n     <p>Darting up the ladder\
  \ that the rebels had left behind, Gaiter swept one of the discarded brushes across\
  \ the blue swords, working the changes he’d seen in his dreams. Subtle alterations\
  \ made more so by the Great Master’s will. A curl here, a swish in the brush texture\
  \ that suggested an almost-word there, a fold between the overlapping red and blue\
  \ that suggested some <i>other</i> color, an un-combination, an unraveling of the\
  \ others that allowed a tiny, tantalizing glimpse beyond their mundane reality.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>He climbed down. Sweat soaked his shirt. That was bloody too, just as\
  \ his tears had been before. He could smell the meat-and-iron taint of it. The Great\
  \ Master’s presence was too terrible for his poor mortal servants to withstand.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Good.” Chemurr stood at the base of the ladder, looking up with satisfaction.\
  \ Her hood had fallen back a bit, showing a bit of her face.</p> \n     <p>Gaiter\
  \ swallowed again, shuddering. The Great Master’s presence was terrible indeed.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Will it… catch the Hellknights?” He wasn’t sure whether to dread or\
  \ hope for that. The snare he’d woven felt too fragile to catch a will like theirs.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“No.” Chemurr’s snort was choked by another worm. “Those mighty knights\
  \ don’t scrub vandals’ paint themselves. They’ll send slaves. Halflings. The resentful,\
  \ the powerless. Fertile soil for the Great Master’s secrets to seed. But…” She\
  \ trailed off. The silence stretched into squirming discomfort.</p> \n     <p>Suddenly\
  \ Chemurr’s hand shot out. Her fingers squelched around Gaiter’s face, muffling\
  \ his screams even as they pried his jaw open. The swollen pustules in her palm\
  \ split open, filling his mouth with the wet slurry of her dissolving humanity and\
  \ with phlegm worms.</p> \n     <p>They poured into him. Writhing, biting, burning,\
  \ <i>melting.</i> Gaiter felt his throat corrode into red melt, and then he was\
  \ swallowing that too, desperately, trying to keep from drowning in his own dying\
  \ flesh. His legs swelled together and burst, puddling into slurry as the worms\
  \ coursed through the liquefaction and smeared it like ink across the ground.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>And then he couldn’t feel anything. He could still hear and could see\
  \ the banners that his eyes had fixed upon before they’d stopped moving or blinking,\
  \ but he felt nothing. Only dread, and a last distant knot of pain somewhere in\
  \ his chest, aching as it faded. His heart, maybe. His soul, before the phlegm worms\
  \ ate it.</p> \n     <p>Chemurr laughed. She was licking her palm to seal it up\
  \ again. A sound he knew too well. “Traitor boy. Did you think the Great Master\
  \ couldn’t sniff out your delusions, too? That you would escape. That you would\
  \ <i>repent.</i> No matter. Even the disloyal are useful. The Hellknights don’t\
  \ come to study vandals’ banners. But they’ll come for you. And the snare <i>you</i>\
  \ are—well, you might catch one.</p> \n     <p>“Rebels and devils, devils and rebels.\
  \ Playing their little games while the Great Master laughs.” Chemurr crooned, softly,\
  \ as the last of Gaiter’s sight and hearing melted into roaring black and whirling,\
  \ poisoned stars. Not death. Not peace. An infinity of rushing madness, a fall that\
  \ never ended. And Chemurr’s voice, and the phlegm worms, forever. “While the Great\
  \ Master laughs.”</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height:\
