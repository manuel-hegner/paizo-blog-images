  \         Swindler, rogue, and occasional Pathfinder ally Guaril Karela has approached\
  \ the Society with an opportunity that Valais Durant, the leader of the Society's\
  \ Radiant Oath faction, can't refuse. Guaril has been charging refugees to sneak\
  \ them out of Xin Edasseril, a city ruled by the Runelord of Envy, and now it looks\
  \ like Guaril won't be able to fulfill his contracts. Society agents are charged\
  \ with sneaking into the dangerous city and sneaking out with a handful of its citizens\
  \ before their absence is noticed so that the Radiant Oath can help them find new\

  \ King. The family's patriarch, the warrior Hlavard Grenskuldr, appears to have\
  \ perished in a shipwreck while wearing the family's heirloom, the gorget of the\
  \ Linnorm King Grehunde the Sunchaser. For one hundred generations the family has\
  \ passed this heirloom down from parent to child, until Hlavard sought to wear it\
  \ on a journey to Valenhall as Grehunde herself had intended to do before perishing\
  \ with the task unfinished. Unwilling to leave the relic to rust away in a watery\
  \ grave, Hlavard's family has requested the Pathfinder Society's assistance in locating\
