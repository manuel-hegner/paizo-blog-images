  \      <br> Illustration by Eva Widermann\n     </div> \n     <p>Ragathiel, child\
  \ of the archdevil Dispater and a goddess of fire, stands on the front line of the\
  \ war between Heaven and Hell. He carves through legions of fiends and drives back\
  \ lesser evils with the mere presence of his awful majesty.</p> \n     <p>Ragathiel\
  \ is a tower of glorious might. He stands almost 20 feet tall, and five lofty burning\
  \ wings stretch from his back. The General of Vengeance once had six wings, but\
  \ one was severed, torn from his body by Dispater himself.</p> \n     <p>Ragathiel's\
  \ tainted heritage has left him with a wrathful heart, and the angel struggles constantly\
  \ to master his baser impulses in service to the light. For thousands of years he\
  \ strove to prove himself to the angelic choirs of Heaven. In the Maelstrom he wrestled\
  \ for 16 years with a monstrous evil serpent whose scales wept acidic blood until\
  \ he was able to choke the life out of it. He led an entire army against one of\
  \ the iron fortresses of Avernus and burned the castle to the ground with holy fire,\
  \ single-handedly maiming Infernal Duke Deumus in the process. Finally the other\
  \ empyreal lords agreed to admit Ragathiel into their ranks, and now they appear\
  \ to trust the angel completelyâ€”though that trust took centuries to develop.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Ragathiel takes an active role in the battle against Hell's fiendish\
  \ legions. He shines at the head of his army, a figure of golden light cleaving\
  \ through the ranks of devils that face him. Soldiers of all kinds, but particularly\
  \ knights, pay homage to Ragathiel and pray for his virtue and wrathful strength\
  \ in battle. Those who have taken vows, especially those of duty or vengeance, hold\
  \ Ragathiel as their ideal, and his agents sometimes assist those who have been\
  \ grievously wronged and now seek righteous vengeance.</p> \n     <p>The lower slopes\
  \ of Heaven are home to Ragathiel's Fortress, a magnificent steel structure designed\
  \ to withstand a thousand-year siege if need be.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Cassidy<br>\
