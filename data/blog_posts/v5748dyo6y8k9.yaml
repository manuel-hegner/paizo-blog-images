  \     <blockquote>\n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Héébe, ’Finders! Koonííni'í\
  íni? (<em>Hello, ’Finders! How’re things?) </em></p>\n      <p>It’s November, and\
  \ that means here on Turtle Island in the United States, we celebrate Native American\
  \ Heritage Month! This cultural heritage month was first observed in 1990, after\
  \ being signed into law by President George H.W. Bush. Native American Heritage\
  \ Month honors the Indigenous people of Turtle Island, recognizes the damage colonization\
  \ wreaked on these many and varied nations, and celebrates the achievements of Native\
  \ people throughout history.</p>\n      <p>This year’s theme is “Honoring the Past,\
  \ Recognizing the Present, Making Stories for the Future,” with a focus on preserving\
  \ Indigenous culture and heritage by passing it down to new generations and encouraging\
  \ Native youth. Some of our contributors used this theme as inspiration for their\
  \ submissions!</p>\n      <p>Content warning: Some submissions discuss anti-Native\
  \ racism, residential schools, and cultural trauma.</p>\n      <br>\n      <div\

  \ benefit of getting is older is that you truly just stop giving a damn about what\
  \ others think about you. When I was in elementary school, I was a lot more open\
  \ about being Black and Seminole and was subjected to a lot of abuse, resulting\
  \ in me hiding away my Indigenous heritage.</p>\n      <p>Now, I design my own games\
  \ and write my own stories, which means I want them to reflect parts of my lived\
  \ experiences. I do my best to incorporate more of my heritage into my work, such\
  \ as my writing work in <em>Backchannels</em>, or directly working with my friend\
  \ Robin Perera to create an Indigenous character in <em>Spellbound: a magical mystery</em>.</p>\n\
  \      <p>It's my hope that doing this not only helps other Indigenous folx out\
  \ there, but reaches back to my younger self and gives them a tight hug of support.\
  \ Indigenous people aren't just a symbol of the past. We're here, we're living,\
  \ we're thriving. We'll continue to do so.</p>\n      <br>\n      <h3>David N. Ross\
  \ (he/him)</h3>\n      <p>You might know my work from the Fists of the Ruby Phoenix\
  \ Adventure Path (I loved the social maneuvering as much as the set-piece fights),\
  \ Pathfinder Adventure Path: Abomination Vaults (5E), or any of the dozens of sourcebooks\
  \ I've contributed to. As a longtime Paizo freelancer of mixed Ojibwe and Euroamerican\
  \ roots, my mixed-race experience has long informed the way I think about designing\
  \ mixed ancestries going back to my work on the&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder</em><em>Advanced\
  \ Race Guide&nbsp;</em>and other First Edition supplements. I was also happy to\
  \ adapt the baykok of Ojibwe legend for&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder</em><em>Bestiary 3</em>.</p>\n\
  \      <p>In the coming months, I'm looking forward to the release of some articles\
  \ drawing on the stories of my Ojibwe family for <em>Drintera® Magazine</em> in\
  \ January and February, which you can find out more about over here:</p>\n     \

  \      <br>\n      <h3>Rue Dickey (they/he/xe)</h3>\n      <p>Being a reconnecting\
  \ Native is at once a beautiful and deeply painful experience, especially when my\
  \ grandfather’s “adoption” records weren’t unsealed until I was an adult. Many Native\
  \ people experience this disconnect from our homes and cultures because for much\
  \ of the United States’ history, we were forcibly removed by residential schools,\
  \ adoption programs, and discriminatory laws. But as more and more of those boxes\
  \ are being unsealed and tape is being cut, we can experience the joy of knowing\
  \ where we come from.</p>\n      <p>I consider myself very lucky to live in an area\
  \ with a thriving Native population—and a Native Community Center!—because being\
  \ in community is one of the most healing things a person can experience. Recently,\
  \ I’ve been attending beadwork classes, learning from elders and master crafters,\
  \ and while I’m far from that, I’m proud to have finished several pieces since my\
  \ first class. Learning the arts and skills of our elders is matched only in importance\
  \ by learning their stories, so our cultures can continue to live and thrive.</p>\n\

  \ someone who helped write stories they can see themselves in.</p>\n      <br>\n\
  \      <h3>Sara Jeffers (she/they/he)</h3>\n      <p>Sara Jeffers is a Two-Spirit\
  \ member of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, in what is now\
  \ known as Washington and British Columbia. Their heritage and culture influence\
  \ not only her graphic and narrative designs but also his approaches in problem-solving\
  \ and community building.</p>\n      <p>In writing <em>Starfinder Bounty #10: Those\
  \ who were Taken</em>, Sara was reminded of the horrific abuses that their family\
  \ members underwent in the Tribal Schools programs in the 20th century. The idea\
  \ that these innocents were being abducted, abused, and reprogrammed unless saved\
  \ resonated with the stories she'd heard growing up about attempted school rescues\
  \ and the children never forgotten. When they explained to a family elder what the\
  \ Starfinder adventure was about, they got a tired but warm smile. \"It is good\
  \ to save the children.\"</p>\n      <p>That mantra drives her, and the desire to\
  \ be in community with others, something that Jeffers took for granted as a youth,\
  \ led him to create Meadowlark Productions, a TTRPG channel focused specifically\
  \ on raising money for various charities, saving the children one game at a time.\
  \ In December, Meadowlark will produce an entire month of games that benefit Project\
  \ Hope. Find us at:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/meadowlarkproductions\"\
