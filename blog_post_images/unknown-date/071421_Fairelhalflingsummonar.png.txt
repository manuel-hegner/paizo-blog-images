| summary  = Ha female Uhlam halfling. She has light skin with freckles and a rosy completion from having spent long days out in the wild. Her hair is reddish/brown, and it runs a bit wild with twigs, leaves, and maybe even a small vine wrapped up inside (some of it looks accidental, but a few bits might be intentionally placed). She’s barefoot, wearing a rough spun tunic and simple breeches that mostly have earth tones with green highlights and leaf patterning. Overall, it looks like she might have rolled around in a bush a bit. Around her neck, she has a wolf-tooth pendant. She holds a gnarled walking staff in one hand, while mystical green runes surround her other hand, as if she’s casting a spell. Finally, she has a mystical symbol on her neck, like three comets trailing each other. This symbol is identical to the one on her wolf companion.
