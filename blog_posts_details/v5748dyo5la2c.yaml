  artist: "tradition, and later by an addendum to the city's charter, the Sable Company\
    \ does not answer to the leader of Korvosa, regardless of the leader's title.\
    \ Instead, the commandant of the Sable Company reports directly to the Seneschal\
    \ of Castle Korvosa. Commandant Marcus Thalassinus Endrin leads his hippogriff-mounted\
    \ marines in defense of the skies and waters of Korvosa. Shipboard raids and airborne\
    \ threats fall under the jurisdiction of the black-clad Sable Company, and its\
    \ members offer aerial and amphibious support to Korvosan Guard operations. The\
    \ Sable Company works closely with the Korvosan Guard and relies on its ties with\
    \ that group to coordinate efforts with the Hellknights and Acadamae (neither\
    \ of which the Sable Company gets along with). Mike McArtor GameMastery Associate\
    \ Editor"
