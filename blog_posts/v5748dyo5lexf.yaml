  >PaizoCon is less than 24 hours away, are you ready to get your gaming on?</span></p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Registration starts at 7am tomorrow</b> July 5th. We do go pretty\
  \ fast getting people their packets, tickets and swag bags and we kindly request\
  \ that if you do not have any early morning events you wait until 8am to line up\
  \ so that attendees and volunteers with early games can get through the line before\
  \ their game's start time. </p> \n    <p>To pick up your badge, please make sure\
  \ you have your photo ID ready to go. Each attendee needs to pick up their own badge\
  \ and minors should pick up badges with a parent or guardian present. </p> \n  \
  \  <h2>So, what's to do while you're here?</h2> \n    <p>In addition to tons of\
  \ gaming going on, we have lots of seminars, game demos and Pathfinder Society.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>We have two very large seminar rooms and most seminars in Evergreen\
  \ Salons F &amp; G are nowhere near capacity for ticketed attendees. Please be respectful\
  \ of seminars taking place just before the one you might want to get into and wait\
  \ until the allotted time before entering the room to keep distractions to a minimum.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>Pathfinder Online (Mt. Rainer Room) and The Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Card Game (Washington Ballroom) will be running demos 8am-6pm Friday and Saturday\
  \ and from 9am-1pm on Sunday. Sasquatch Game Studio is hosting Thule Playtests (in\
  \ Evergreen Salon I) on Friday from 2pm-6pm and Saturday 1pm-5pm. </p> \n    <p>And\
  \ of course, there will be lots of Pathfinder Society. If you didn't sign up in\
  \ advance, just head over to Pathfinder Society Head Quarters in the Washington\
  \ Ballroom and the volunteers there will do their best get you set up with a game.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>It wouldn't be a gaming convention without room for open gaming\
  \ and we've got lots of room if you find friends new or old and want to get a game\
  \ going on-the-fly. Find an open table in Seattle Rooms 1, 2 or 3 or in Evergreen\
  \ Salon H or I. Some tables are reserved during certain times for scheduled games,\
  \ but there should be plenty of open spaces for groups to sit down and play. Please\
  \ note, the Seattle Rooms 1, 2, &amp; 3 and Evergreen Salons H &amp; I do not open\
  \ for PaizoCon attendees until 2pm on Friday.</p> \n    <p>Near registration there\
  \ is an <b>Event Ticket Trading Board</b>. If you missed out on online registration\
  \ or are looking to pick up an event head over there and see if anyone has dropped\
  \ off events they are no longer able to attend. I've seeded the board with events\
  \ that had less than 10 spots available when we closed online event registration.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>If you didn't purchase a <b>banquet ticket</b> before they sold\
  \ out, but still want to attend the Preview Banquet, we <b>may</b> have a few extra\
  \ tickets for sale at the door. They will be $25.00 cash (exact amount only please).\
  \ Line up next to (but not in) the general banquet ticket line and if there are\
  \ any open seats they will be sold on a first come first serve basis. The availability\
  \ of these extra tickets is not a guarantee. </p> \n    <p>If you're attendees looking\
  \ to connect with other gamers or sitting at home wondering what's going on at PaizoCon,\
