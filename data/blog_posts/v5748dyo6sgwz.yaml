  \ \n     <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">“I thought you said the\
  \ signal was coming from a ruin,” Velloro said into his comm unit, looking up at\
  \ the huge, very intact fortification in front of him with a large, unruined door\
  \ blocking the way forward. The captain’s response was garbled, no doubt thanks\
  \ to the rocky, mountainous terrain between him and the <i>Sunrise Maiden</i>. “\
  Ye… …is th… …thing there?”</p> \n      <p>Rolling his eyes dramatically for the\
  \ sake of his companions, who had instinctively turned toward the comm unit to try\
  \ to decode Navasi’s transmission, Velloro shrugged. “Guess we’re improvising, Chk\
  \ Chk,“ he said, winking at Keskodai’s larval son as he spun slowly in his protective\
  \ canister. “Raia, can you get that door open?”</p> \n      <p>Before the technomancer\
  \ could respond, a recess in the doorframe began to flicker with a dim red light\
  \ that grew brighter and more steady. As it did, the ground thrummed with the energy\
  \ of a long-dormant system sputtering to life. </p> \n      <p><i>“Yes—I’ll get\
  \ the door,”</i> Raia’s telepathic response darted through the hallways of Velloro’\
  s mind as she began casting a spell that would magically bypass the door’s locks.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>Several other vertical recesses in the wall drew Velloro’s eyes as\
  \ they, too, activated. Boxy machines rose out of the staggered parapets, topped\
  \ with gleaming barrels pointing straight up, then swiveled down to point directly\
  \ at Velloro and his friends.</p> \n      <p>“Fall in—<i>NOW!</i>” Velloro’s last\
  \ word was a telepathic shout to prevent the opening salvo of eight massive turrets\
  \ firing heavy rounds from drowning it out. With no time to be polite, he pushed\
  \ through his companions, knocking them off balance. Raia’s spell failed as her\
  \ concentration faltered, but she immediately began to cast it again, cleaving close\
  \ to Velloro as he raised his shield just in time to intercept the first wave of\
  \ pounding projectiles.</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/100319_Velloro.jpg\"\

  \ alt=\"Velloro, the iconic lashunta vanguard, uses his energy shield to protect\

  \ wall ahead of them.\"></a> \n       <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Illustration\
  \ by Setiawan Lee</p> \n      </div> \n      <p>As he often did in these situations,\
  \ Velloro began to experience time much more slowly, to take notice of everything\
  \ around him more carefully. He saw the firing mechanism jam on the fourth turret\
  \ to the left of the entryway. He felt the heavy, staccato thud of rounds as they\
  \ slammed into the ground just feet away and began to describe a dotted line that\
  \ would momentarily bring the molten-hot metal slugs into contact with his shield,\
  \ his armor—and possibly his friends.</p> \n      <p>The firing seemed to slow,\
  \ but Velloro knew the automated turrets were cycling shots to prevent overheating;\
  \ those towers wouldn’t run out of ammunition any time soon. Raia, somehow sounding\
  \ out of breath despite being in his head, said <i>“I’ve got the door,”</i> and\
  \ it slid open with unnerving silence and speed.</p> \n      <p>Three red-scaled,\
  \ lizardlike ikeshtis wearing sand-tattered defrex hides skidded to a stop just\
  \ in front of the entryway. They had been running toward stairs leading to the top\
  \ of the wall, but now they turned to the intruders, semi-auto pistols in their\
  \ clawed hands.</p> \n      <p>Velloro immediately charged the startled ikeshtis,\
  \ smiling as he did. With each step, he drew more and more energy from the ground\
  \ beneath his feet pushing back at him, until he’d gathered an invisible storm of\
  \ entropy around himself, a cloak of molecular disorder that easily deflected the\
  \ ikeshtis’ first few panicked shots. In just a few seconds, he was among them,\
  \ facing down the biggest one as the two next to him flinched in anticipation.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>The large ikeshti took the opportunity to fire at the lashunta nearly\
  \ point blank, two bullets screaming toward the ancient rune of Castrovel glowing\
  \ in the middle of Velloro’s chest plate. Velloro grunted with the impact of the\
  \ first, yet this he could use. As the atoms of the bullet interacted with those\
  \ of his armor, disorder bloomed like a coalescing storm cloud. Molecular lattices\
  \ broke and reformed in countless chain reactions, ones Velloro could shape, divert,\
  \ invest—and control. As the second bullet hit fractions of a second later, Velloro\
  \ used the explosive energy of the first, all its waste heat and shrapnel and friction,\
  \ to mitigate the damage from the second. The shiny metal round clinked harmlessly\
  \ off his armor, no more destructive than an idly flicked pebble. </p> \n      <p>The\
  \ lizard creatures on either side of Velloro raised their guns, taking advantage\
  \ of the momentary distraction to aim at Raia and Keskodai. But Velloro was ready\
  \ to react, grabbing the barrels of both weapons with either hand and crumpling\
  \ them as though they were made of thin-pressed aluminum, before dropping them to\
  \ the ground with a smirk.</p> \n      <p>Velloro turned his attention back to the\
  \ one ikeshti that was still armed and swung his fist in a wide arc, gathering the\
  \ remaining excess energy into his chest before sending it screaming to his shoulder,\
  \ down his arm, and into his fist, where it whirled and careened in an ever-growing\
  \ nimbus of destructive energy. As his fist made contact with the stunned ikeshti,\
  \ Velloro cut the tether with the disorder he’d hoarded, sending it fully into the\
  \ creature’s dry and brittle armor, which splintered and caved in. The ikeshti fell\
  \ to the ground writhing in pain, futilely scratching at the ruined clasps of its\
  \ armor in a desperate attempt to relieve the crushing pressure.</p> \n      <p>As\
  \ Velloro turned back to the other two ikeshtis, who’d drawn their batons and were\
  \ advancing on him cautiously, a gruff and incredulous voice rang out from somewhere\
  \ high up, bouncing off the towering flat walls of the fort.</p> \n      <p>“Velloro?”\
  </p> \n      <p>He looked up and knew her immediately, a towering and extremely\
  \ familiar shobhad who was shouldering a sniper rifle that had moments ago been\
  \ leveled at Velloro’s head. As the shobhad held two of her four hands out to stop\
  \ the ikeshtis, Velloro grinned at Keskodai, who had already begun to focus on ripping\
  \ the newcomer’s mind apart with his own. </p> \n      <p><i>“Hold on a sec, bud.\
