  \ Been There!</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\"> Thursday, June 18, 2009 </p> \n   <p>That\
  \ sound you heard last Sunday night (heard 'round the world, I'm told) was not Krakatoa\
  \ II (electric boogaloo?), it was the enormous sigh of relief from me as PAIZOCON\
  \ 2009 came to a close and did so with a feeling of great satisfaction.</p> \n \
  \  <p>A little over a year ago, I spent a Saturday morning in a little hotel in\
  \ Kirkland, WA and watched a small group of Paizo fans, led by Timitius and Lilith\
  \ from our boards, gather and enjoy each other's company as fellow Paizo community\
  \ members. Right then and there I said to myself, \"Self,\" I said, \"We have to\
  \ take this over and help them grow it.\" So when it came time to plan the 2009\
  \ convention season the first thing on my agenda was How Do We Politely Tell Tim\
  \ That PAIZOCON is Ours Now and Yet Still Get His Help? Well, it turns out, it was\
  \ really easy.</p> \n   <p>I had lunch with Tim last fall and laid the cards on\
  \ the table. I asked Tim what he thought if Paizo wanted to get into PAIZOCON in\
  \ a really big way for the second year—as in, so big that we basically ran it as\
  \ an official show. Tim's face was 100% relief and he was thrilled to get the planning\
  \ process off his shoulders. I, in turn, was thrilled to take it on and despite\
  \ many late nights and a lot of work, I couldn't be more happy at how it all turned\
  \ out.</p> \n   <p>For me, PAIZOCON 2009 began on Friday morning with my arrival\
  \ at the Coast Bellevue Hotel. Jeff, Cosmo, Chris, and I set up the sales booth,\
  \ taped up all the signs, and then waited for the hordes to come. And come they\
  \ did! It was amazing to finally put faces to names and say hello to a lot of folks\
  \ that I'd been reading about on the boards for years. Additionally, a lot of new\
  \ faces showed up as well—folks who maybe lurked on the boards, or were only familiar\
  \ with Paizo and the Beta and just wanted to come and see what Paizo was all about\
  \ in person. Our special guests were already at the show and folks like Monte and\
  \ Sue Cook, Eva Widermann, Wolfgang Bauer, and the entire Paizo staff immediately\
  \ took to mingling with the attendees.</p> \n   <p>And then the gaming began! RPGs,\
  \ board games, card games, you name it and someone was playing it. At times we'd\
  \ sit there at registration and think, \"Wow, it got really slow around here suddenly\"\
  \ and that was because the breakout rooms and the ballroom were stuffed to the gills\
  \ with gaming, gaming, gaming. Laughter, dice rolls, howls of defeat, and cries\
  \ of success echoed through the halls of the Coast Bellevue and we knew right then\
  \ that we'd done something right—PAIZOCON 2009 was going to be a success.</p> \n\
  \   <p>Saturday was a long day of gaming that ended with a huge banquet for the\
  \ attendees. The food was fantastic, the company even better, and it was pushed\
  \ over the top by a keynote address from Paizo CEO Lisa Stevens, a lengthy preview\
  \ of the PRPG by Lead Designer Jason Bulmahn, a preview of things to come by Publisher\
  \ Erik Mona, and a really boring, stuffy, and not very fun quiz game lamely put\
  \ together by yours truly. (Okay, so the quiz game was awesome! Most fun I've had\
  \ in front of crowd since the WTO Riots in 1999.)</p> \n   <p>Sunday was additional\
  \ gaming fun as the show slowly started to wind down. Folks began collecting in\
  \ the lobby and just hanging out—sharing gaming stories, asking the PAIZOCON special\
  \ guest in the seat next to them about their RPG favorites, and just basking in\
  \ the glow of a successful and fun weekend of all things Paizo and beyond.</p> \n\
  \   <p>With the show behind me now, I've already started thinking about next year.\
  \ In fact, as I write this, I'm 15 minutes away from the first meeting to do just\
  \ that: plan PAIZOCON 2010 and figure how, exactly, we're going to be able to top\
  \ 2009. For those of you who were there, I hope you had fun and played games to\
  \ your heart's content. For those who couldn't make it—do not, I repeat, DO NOT\
  \ miss out on the opportunity next year. I imagine it'll only be better.</p> \n\
  \   <p>Thanks, everyone!</p> \n   <div align=\"center\">\n    <table border=\"0\"\
