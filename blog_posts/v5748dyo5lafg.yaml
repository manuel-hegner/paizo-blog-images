  /pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj\"><i>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook</i></a>\

  \ Since we’re done looking at the core classes, this week we’re exploring the heights\
  \ of power with Seltyiel, the iconic eldritch knight.</p> \n   <blockquote>\n  \

  0\" align=\"right\"></a> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>Starting off, the eldritch knight\
  \ prestige class works much as it did in 3.5, but we’ve added a few abilities to\
  \ spice things up. The class provides Seltyiel with a fast base attack progression\
  \ and nine levels of spellcasting (bringing his total caster level up to 14th, although\
  \ the <i>orange prism ioun stone</i> puts his caster level at 15th). The class also\
  \ grants three bonus feats, at 1st, 5th, and 9th. With these he can select any of\
  \ the combat feats that he qualifies for (same as a fighter). In addition, starting\
  \ at 1st level, Seltyiel gained diverse training, which adds his eldritch knight\
  \ levels to both his fighter levels and his arcane spellcasting class’s levels for\
  \ the purposes of qualifying for feats. This allows him to take feats that would\
  \ normally be reserved for 15th-level fighters and wizards (but more on that later).\
  \ Finally, upon gaining his 10th level in eldritch knight, Seltyiel gained the spell\
  \ critical feature. Whenever Seltyiel scores a critical hit, he can cast any spell\
  \ as a swift action without increasing the spell’s level. The spell does not provoke\
  \ an attack of opportunity and must include the target of the critical hit as one\
  \ of the spell’s targets or put him within the area of the effect. Its bad enough\
  \ to be hit with a critical, but to add a <i>cone of cold</i> on top of it can truly\
  \ be devastating.</p> \n   <p>Although quite capable in melee combat, Seltyiel has\
  \ a wide variety of powerful spells at his disposal as well. <i>Grasping hand</i>\
  \ can grapple foes with a +26 bonus on its combat maneuver check. <i>Form of the\
  \ dragon I</i> allows him to take on the shape of a Medium dragon of any color,\
  \ gaining its attacks, breath weapon, and a host of resistances and other abilities.\
  \ <i>Polymorph</i> mimics a host of other spells that allow him to change shape,\
  \ allowing him to become an animal, humanoid, or even an elemental. Although not\
  \ incredibly powerful for a 20th-level character, four <i>fireball</i> spells are\
  \ nothing to overlook.</p> \n   <p>Beyond spells, Seltyiel has a vast number of\
  \ feats which increase his combat prowess. Many of these feats are for fighters\
  \ only, but Seltyiel qualifies thanks to his diverse training class feature. Arcane\
  \ Armor Training allows Seltyiel to spend a swift action to reduce his armor spell\
  \ failure chance by 10%, which eliminates it altogether in his case. Critical Mastery\
  \ is a fighter-only feat that allows Seltyiel to apply the effects of two critical\
  \ feats to a successful critical hit. In his case, that means that anyone who is\
  \ struck with a critical hit is both staggered (can only take a standard action\
  \ each round) and fatigued, thanks to Staggering Critical and Tiring Critical. This\
  \ is, of course, in addition to the 1d10 electricity damage from the sword and a\
  \ free spell (thanks to spell critical). Seltyiel also possesses the Disruptive\
  \ feat (another fighter-only feat), which makes it harder for spellcasters to cast\
  \ on the defensive while he is adjacent (+4 to the DC). To top it off, he has Spellbreaker\
  \ (fighters only, once again), which allows him to take an attack of opportunity\
  \ against foes that fail on their check to cast defensively. Finally, Seltyiel has\
  \ the Penetrating Strike fighter-only feat. This feat allows him to ignore 5 points\
  \ of damage reduction with every attack made with his longsword (except for DR/—\
  ). Greater Penetrating Strike ignores 10 points of DR (and 5 points of DR/—), but\
  \ Seltyiel couldn’t quite qualify for this feat, which requires you to be a 16th-level\
  \ fighter.</p> \n   <p>I should also spend a moment talking about Seltyiel’s specialization.\
  \ Being an evoker, he gains intense spells at 1st level, granting him a bonus on\
  \ damage spells equal to 1/2 his wizard level (in this case, only 2 because the\
  \ levels of eldritch knight don’t count). He also gains force missile, which acts\
  \ like a <i>magic missile</i> that he can fire one at a time, up to 9 times per\
  \ day, adding his bonus from intense spells to each missile. Seltyiel is also a\
  \ half-elf, which comes with a +2 bonus to one ability score of his choice, the\
  \ Skill Focus feat for free, and the ability to pick two favored classes (in this\
  \ case, fighter and wizard).</p> \n   <p>Finally, lets take a look at Seltyiel’\
  s potent magic items. At this level, Seltyiel has around 880,000 gp of magic items,\
  \ but much of that is spent on a number of particularly expensive items. Both his\
  \ armor and his sword take up nearly a quarter of his total value, but items like\
  \ the <i>quicken metamagic rod, staff of evocation</i>, and <i>ring of wizardry\
  \ (III)</i> eat up a fair amount as well. Of note is his <i>ring of regeneration</i>\
  \ which now restores 1 hit point per round and makes him immune to bleed damage.\
  \ It’s certainly useful, allowing it to regain all of his hit points in just over\
  \ 17 minutes, but costs 90,000 gp.</p> \n   <p>There’s only one more preview left\
  \ before the release of the <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj\"><i>Core Rulebook</i></a>!\
  \ Accordingly, next week on the day before the game releases, we’re going to take\
  \ a look at the most important rule in the game...</p> \n   <p>Jason Bulmahn<br>\
