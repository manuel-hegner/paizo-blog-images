  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>By Vanessa Hoskins</b></p> \n     <h3>Zhang Yong,\
  \ Spirit Tender</h3> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">In the great fighting tournaments\
  \ across Tian Xia, a competitor will occasionally perish in the heat of battle.\
  \ Sometimes their lust for battle, desire to win, or enduring competitive spirit\
  \ lingers, often resulting in a haunting. When this happens, it’s up to a ghost\
  \ eater to defeat the lingering soul to send it to the afterlife.</p> \n     <p>Ten\
  \ years ago, during the previous Ruby Phoenix Tournament, Yong was a boy of 13 years\
  \ working as a water carrier, though he dreamed of one day fighting in the tournament\
  \ and making a name for himself, especially to set him apart from his many accomplished\
  \ human, orc, and half-orc cousins. Yong imagined showing the world his skill, determination,\
  \ and fierce grasp on life and excelling at something all his own. That very grasp\
  \ saved his life when an errant undead specter disrupted a match, tearing through\
  \ the ringside where Yong was carrying water. Though he was gravely injured in the\
  \ incident, Yong was brought into the care of the tournament’s resident ghost eater\
  \ and, from her, learned how to fight the corruption of lingering souls.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Now, Yong is one of the tournament’s most renown ghost eaters, tasked with\
  \ cleansing any haunts, ghosts, or spiritual phenomena that remain after a particularly\
  \ grueling battle. Though he sometimes shudders at the memory of that terrifying\
  \ day ten years ago, through sheer determination, he carries on, finding that in\
  \ guiding these souls to rest, he’s found not just a way to purge the ghosts of\
  \ his own past, but a rare talent as a spirit tender, one all his own.</p> <a href=\"\

  \ Yong fails or critically fails a saving throw against an enchantment or fear effect<br>\
  \ <b>Effect</b> Yong succeeds on the saving throw instead and takes 2d6 mental damage.\
  \ If he critically failed on the triggering saving throw, he also takes 2d6 persistent\
  \ mental damage and cannot use this ability again while taking persistent mental\
  \ damage.</p> \n     <p><b>Speed</b> 45</p> \n     <p><b>Melee</b> [one-action]\
  \ soul strike +23 (agile, finesse, nonlethal, unarmed), Damage 2d8+14 bludgeoning\
  \ (plus 1d6 lawful against chaotic targets)</p> \n     <p><b>Ranged</b> [one-action]\
  \ greater ghost charge +23 (range 10 feet, thrown), Damage 3d8 positive plus 3 positive\
  \ splash damage</p> \n     <p><b>Disrupting Strikes</b> [one-action] Yong calls\
  \ forth positive energy from within to help him destroy undead. His weapons and\
  \ unarmed Strikes gain the effects of a <em>greater disrupting</em> property rune\
  \ until the start of his next turn (DC 31).</p> \n     <p><b>Reach Beyond</b> Yong\
  \ has learned to move his spiritual energy past himself to attack spirits where\
  \ others can’t. He can make melee Strikes against incorporeal creatures that are\
  \ inside solid objects as long as the object is within his reach. An incorporeal\
  \ creature inside of a solid object is hidden, requiring him to succeed at a DC\
  \ 11 flat check when he targets it. He can spend an action, which has the concentrate\
  \ trait, to focus on a creature inside of a solid object. If he does, the next melee\
  \ Strike he makes this turn requires him to succeed at only a DC 6 flat check to\
  \ affect the creature.</p> \n     <p><b>Soul Dance Stance</b> [one-action] Yong\
  \ begins a stance that aligns him with the River of Souls, allowing him to make\
  \ soul strike attacks that seem almost incorporeal. These deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage;\
  \ are in the brawling group; and have the agile, finesse, nonlethal, and unarmed\
  \ traits. Soul strikes treat cover against living and incorporeal undead targets\
  \ as degree less severe (greater cover becomes standard cover, standard cover becomes\
  \ lesser cover, and lesser cover is ignored).</p> \n     <h4>Plot Hooks</h4> \n\
  \     <p>Game Masters can use the following plot hooks to integrate Zhang Yong into\
  \ their ongoing Pathfinder campaigns.</p> \n     <ul> \n      <li>The players’ competitors\
  \ could be having trouble with a particularly powerful haunt or ghost disrupting\
  \ a practice space and wish to seek Yong’s aid to purge it.</li> \n      <li>The\
  \ competitors hear of Yong’s childhood trauma, and how those memories cause him\
  \ distress today. They may wish to help the young man face those fears and move\
  \ past the pain.</li> \n      <li>The ghost of Yong’s former master has risen for\
  \ this decade’s Ruby Phoenix Tournament, thinking she is still the head ghost eater.\
  \ Yong is having trouble facing his old master alone and seeks the players’ competitors\
  \ for guidance and assistance sending his old master safely to Pharasma’s court.</li>\
