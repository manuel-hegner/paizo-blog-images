  \  <p itemprop=\"description\">The designers of the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game\
  \ can't wait for <a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon</a>! I mean, we can. We're physically\
  \ capable of it. But we don't <i>want</i> to wait for it, because that's when we\
  \ get to show you what we've been cooking up for the last year. At PaizoCon, we'll\
  \ have the first public playtest of the new version of the Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Card Game.</p> \n    <p>Now, the word \"new\" may throw some of you. We've been\
  \ very clear that this isn't a reboot of the game—our baby is going to remain firmly\
  \ in the tub while we change the bathwater. But we've been using that word because\
  \ we want to be open to changes that we might not do if we were \"just\" launching\
  \ our next Adventure Path—Curse of the Crimson Throne—by itself. Since we're making\
  \ a universal base set—that is, a set of cards that can be used with any Adventure\
  \ Path or standalone adventure—we wanted to address just about everything that's\
  \ been on our minds to change about the game for the last five years.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>I'm not going to get too deep into that now, because I want to save some surprises\
  \ for PaizoCon. Specifically, I want you to <i>playtest</i> those changes without\
  \ knowing what they are in advance. Playtesters' reactions have guided us as part\
  \ of the process of every PACG set we've made. We use PaizoCon as an incubator for\
  \ new concepts. After all, the first time anyone outside the Paizo and Lone Shark\
  \ offices saw the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game (codenamed \"Project Swallowtail\"\
  ), it was at <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5ldmo?What-is-this-Project-Swallowtail-thing\"\
  >PaizoCon 2012</a>. And it looked like this:</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Conventions/PaizoCon/PaizoCon2012-9PPDDN_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     <p>Look how clever we were! The W is a swallowtail butterfly!</p>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>The thing we’re taking into PaizoCon 2018 looks like this:</p>\
  \ \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180503-Prototype.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/20180503-Prototype_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     <p>Don’t get too attached to anything you see—it’ll all be different\
  \ by Monday.</p>\n    </div> \n    <p>So we want you to play with us! Even if you\
  \ haven't played much PACG, we want your feedback. And Adventure Card Guild members\
  \ will get rewards for their characters even though we're testing some weirdness\
  \ that may not make sense to them. (They'll get over it.)</p> \n    <p>Here are\
  \ the times we're playtesting.</p> \n    <ul> \n     <li>Friday <a href=\"/events/v5748mkg0lwff\"\
  >8:00 AM-10:00 AM</a>, <a href=\"/events/v5748mkg0lwgf\">11:00 AM-1:00 PM</a>, <a\

  \ you like. Or just come find us at those times. We'd very much like your help.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>And if you'd like to be among the first to find out when the new version\
  \ is coming out, you'll want to make sure you secure your ticket to the <a href=\"\
