  \ Society Organized Play Part XV: Spread the wisdom of Tian Xia within the Inner\
  \ Sea</h1> \n    <p class=\"”date”\">Monday, June 27, 2011</p> \n    <p><i> While\
  \ the Pathfinder Society makes its home in the Grand Lodge of Absalom, its membership\
  \ comes from and travels to all corners of the known world. Outside the Inner Sea\
  \ region, one of the highest concentrations of Pathfinders is on the continent of\
  \ Tian Xia, and specifically in the metropolitan city of Goka. Most Tian Pathfinders\
  \ operate independently of their brethren in Absalom, but occasionally agents cross\
  \ the Crown of the World, make the treacherous naval voyage south around Casmaron,\
  \ or simply teleport to travel between the two hubs of activity. The Lantern Lodge\
  \ represents Tian interests in the Inner Sea region, ensuring that Pathfinder Society\
  \ agents far to the east of the Decemvirate’s direct view are considered in organization-wide\
  \ affairs.</i></p> \n    <div align=\"right\"> \n     <table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"\
  0\" cellpadding=\"3\" align=\"right\">\n      <tbody>\n       <tr>\n        <td><a\
  \ href=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/LanternLodgeSymbol.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderSociety/LanternLodgeSymbol_180.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a></td>\n       </tr>\n      </tbody>\n     </table>\n    </div> \n    <p>When\
  \ we first announced the forthcoming Jade Regent Adventure Path, one of the first\
  \ questions to pop up on the Pathfinder Society forums was whether the campaign\
  \ would be going to this distant land. The answer is undoubtedly yes, my loyal Pathfinders,\
  \ but we won't be abandoning years of development in the Inner Sea region; the campaign\
  \ is still going to be based out of Absalom.</p> \n    <p>But we've got Asian-influenced\
  \ archetypes in <i>Ultimate Magic</i> and <i>Ultimate Combat</i>, and the new ninja\
  \ and samurai alternate classes in the latter, so we needed to find a way to justify\
  \ these characters existing in the Inner Sea region, and explain why we hadn't seen\
  \ them around before. The simplest solution was to introduce a branch of Pathfinders\
  \ focused on Tian Xia or from there, who may have just recently set up a presence\
  \ in Absalom.</p> \n    <p>Thus, the Lantern Lodge was born. Headed by a Gokan venture-captain\
  \ named Amara Li, the Lantern Lodge represents Tian interests in the Inner Sea and\
  \ promotes cooperation between Pathfinders on both sides of the world. Whether the\
  \ Lantern Lodge provides a home away from home to natives of Goka, Minkai, Nagajor,\
  \ or the fractured Successor States of Imperial Lung Wa while they venture into\
  \ Avistan and Garund on their own explorations, or whether it provides resources\
  \ for Pathfinders from the Inner Sea region who want to experience the wonders of\
  \ Tian Xia, the Lantern Lodge has an important role to play within the Pathfinder\
  \ Society as a whole.</p> \n    <p>At this point, there are no plans to add Tian\
  \ Xia-based PC races to the campaign, but those who want to play a ninja, samurai,\
  \ or exiled Tian noble now have a faction whose missions fit their flavor, all within\
  \ the context of the Pathfinder Society as a whole. Instead of swearing allegiance\
  \ to a country thousands of miles from their homeland, they can remain loyal to\
  \ the lands that birthed them on the other side of the Wall of Heaven mountains.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Two new factions down, three to go! Next week, we'll look at the Sczarni,\
  \ the loosely organized Varisian criminal network, and see how they fit in with\
  \ the Pathfinder Society. What could these two organizations possibly have to gain\
  \ from allying with one another? Find out next week—same path-time, same path-channel.</p>\
