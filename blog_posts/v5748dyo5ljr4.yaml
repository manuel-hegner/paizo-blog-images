  \ Seattle area transitions from chilly and wet to \"sunny yet inexplicably still\
  \ raining,\" so too is the Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild team eager to get\
  \ outside and explore some exciting locations. We're also pleased to have an exciting\
  \ Season 9 schedule in place along with the name and logo, much of which we'll announce\
  \ at <a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon 2017</a>, so be sure to attend the PaizoCon\
  \ Preview Banquet and the organized play panel the following day to ask any questions\
  \ you have. In the meantime, let me share a few more secrets about this month's\
  \ scenarios—both of which lead into our PaizoCon releases!</p> \n    <p>We kick\
  \ off the race into convention season with an infamous race in Garund: the famous\
  \ Sargava Chalice, a survival footrace through the unforgiving wilderness just south\
  \ of the Mwangi Expanse. In recent years, the race has become increasingly deadly,\
  \ and the Pathfinder Society has proposed allowing teams to compete as a way to\
  \ revitalize the contest. The PCs are representing the Pathfinder Society in the\
  \ race, and if they can brave the traceless frontier while fending off both beasts\
  \ and rival competitors, they might walk away with the chalice itself—a relic with\
  \ which the Society can unlock a cyclops ruin from antiquity. Lace up your racing\
  \ shoes in <a href=\"/products/btpy9ret?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-818-Champions-Chalice-Part-1-Blazing-Dangerous-Trails\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-18: Champion's Chalice, Part 1: Blazing Dangerous\
  \ Trails</em></a> by Benjamin Bruck, bravely treaded new ground by adapting a simplified\
  \ version of <a href=\"/products/btpy9j6p?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Ultimate-Intrigue\"\
  ><em>Ultimate Intrigue</em>'s</a> pursuit rules to track the PCs' progress. Just\
  \ be warned that one rule hasn't changed: contestants begin the race with nothing\
  \ but themselves and the cloths on their backs. Time is of the essence in this Tier\
  \ 1-5 adventure!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/PZOPSS0818E-Bunawei.jpg\"\

  \ \n    <p>Thus far the Pathfinder Society has traveled the elemental planes, compiling\
  \ what it needs to shatter the <em>Untouchable Opal</em>. We're yet to visit the\
  \ Plane of Water, and that ends this month as the Society is in pursuit of a crucial\
  \ tool to realize its goal. Many years ago, the ingenious Pathfinder Zahra was <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy8i11?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-218-The-Forbidden-Furnace-of-Forgotten-Koor\"\
  >investigating the unforgiving ruins of Koor</a>, and she has since shifted her\
  \ sights to the magnificent metropolis of Vialesk, a hub for visitors to the Plane\
  \ of Water. Tragic circumstances ruined the first expedition and tarnished her reputation,\
  \ but she suspects foul play and has recruited the PCs to find out what really happened.\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy9reu?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-819-Treacherous-Waves\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-19: Treacherous Waters</em></a> is an exciting\
  \ urban adventure set in the underwater city of Vialesk, full of strange environments\
  \ and even stranger characters. Its author, Eleanor Ferron, not only contributed\
  \ to <a href=\"/products/btpy9mb9?Pathfinder-Society-Quest-Honors-Echo\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ Quests: Honor's Echo</em></a>, but she also made the Plane of Water come alive\
  \ in <a href=\"/products/btpy9ng0?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Planes-of-Power\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Planes of Power</em></a>, making this Tier 3-7\
  \ adventure a real testament to her abilities and knowledge of the setting.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>As a note for <em>Treacherous Waters</em>, keep in mind that its events\
  \ tie closely to <a href=\"/products/btpy9rev?Pathfinder-Society-Scenario-820-Torrents-Last-Will\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-20: Torrent's Last Will</a>, a Tier 7-11 adventure\
  \ coming out next month. It's not necessary to play these with the same character,\
  \ though I do recommend playing them in order.</p> \n    <p>John Compton<br> <i>Organized\
