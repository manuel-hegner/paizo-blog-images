  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Friday, July 23, 2010</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"\
  > \n    <p>Deference and respect are the privileges of noble birth. Few know this\
  \ better than the man who calls himself Alain, yet equally well does he know that\
  \ such things are not always freely given where they are due. And in those cases,\
  \ it's the burden of the nobly born to correct the error, and to take by force that\
  \ which is their right.</p> \n    <p>Alain was born in Taldor with the proverbial\
  \ silver spoon in his mouth, son of a wealthy but relatively minor noble house.\
  \ As a boy, he showed remarkable affinity for both physical activities—especially\
  \ the martial pursuits—and the ins and outs of courtly etiquette and intrigue. Though\
  \ both traits made him the quite popular with the peerage—especially the young ladies\
  \ of the court, necessitating more than one woman being shuffled off to a nunnery\
  \ on a nine-month \"vacation\"—Alain's wealth and natural abilities also gave him\
  \ an excessively healthy sense of self-importance, sometimes getting him into trouble\
  \ that would have crippled a man of lower station. By the time Alain's father realized\
  \ that the cane-scarred whipping boy might not be the most effective means of corralling\
  \ his youngest son, Alain was already near grown, and thoroughly convinced of his\
  \ own competence in all things.</p> \n    <p>Though Alain regularly dismissed such\
  \ noble studies as literature and linguistics—\"If the elves want to speak, let\
  \ them learn a man's language\"—he could never get enough of bards' tales of battle\
  \ and bloodshed, often keeping the minstrels at his favorite taverns playing late\
  \ into the night. Excel as he might at the joust or the ritualized combat of the\
  \ nobility, he longed for the primal exultation of war, where his mastery over his\
  \ fellow men would not just be avowed or lauded, but proved undeniably by the blood\
  \ on his sword, as clear as the red-dripping talons of an eagle. He had the nobility\
  \ of society. Now he wanted the nobility of nature.</p> \n   </div>\n  </blockquote>\

  \ clash of arms lay far beyond the borders of his father's expansive holdings, and\
  \ neither his father nor his two elder brothers showed the slightest desire to sustain\
  \ a blood feud with another house. All three men attempted to turn Alain to knighthood,\
  \ a socially safe and proper outlet for his bloodlust, yet the idea of serving as\
  \ a squire for any length of time—of letting someone <i>else</i> give <i>him</i>\
  \ orders!—was unthinkable to young Alain. At last, when he could stand it no longer,\
  \ the young scion gathered what funds and personal affects he could carry and declared\
  \ himself a sellsword, setting off for the \"crimson poetry of the fray.\"</p> \n\
  \   <p>True warfare has little in common with heroic ballads, and few who see its\
  \ raw and naked face come back unchanged. Certainly this was true for Alain. Yet\
  \ where some men learn wisdom in the wrack, at last understanding the price of a\
  \ life and the senseless ease with which it's taken, Alain learned something else.\
  \ In the clash of spears and the screams of horses, the man who had been a trumped-up\
  \ merchant's son became an elemental force of destruction, cutting down swaths of\
  \ men who were never his enemies, but merely his opponents. Though he became rich\
  \ in his own right off of the heavy purses his patrons heaped upon him, Alain cared\
  \ only for what the rewards represented: that here was a man whose worth was proven,\
  \ in fire and iron.</p> \n   <p>Today, Alain wanders as he wills, taking commissions\
  \ when they suit his fancy and embarking on his own expeditions when they don't.\
  \ Thanks to his prowess on the battlefield, warriors are often drawn to fight at\
  \ his side, and to Alain's secret surprise he's developed quite a knack for leading\
  \ them, issuing gruff and decisive commands. These companions are almost always\
  \ cohorts rather than friends—though Alain does a fine job of managing his troops\
  \ and urging them on to ever-greater feats, long experience has taught him that\
  \ soldiers are a short-lived lot, and hence he sheds few tears when it's time to\
  \ pay the butcher's bill.</p> \n   <p>As much as his life revolves around the battlefield,\
  \ Alain still retains the social graces that made him so popular (for better or\
  \ worse) in the courts of his upbringing. If greeting another warrior or potential\
  \ client, he may introduce himself as simply Alain, comporting himself with a calculated\
  \ aloofness designed to increase others' opinions of his abilities. Where an attractive\
  \ lady is concerned, however, his rough edges immediately smooth, and many are the\
  \ highborn women who've fallen prey to the \"rogue knight\" calling himself Alain\
  \ Germande, Third Son of House Germande, Bearer of the Shielding Spear—and any other\
  \ honorifics that strike his fancy.</p> \n   <p>In truth, whether leading soldiers\
  \ in a suicidal charge or booting serving girls out of his bed in the morning, Alain\
  \ cares little about the people around him. More than money, love, or lust, Alain\
  \ cares about his reputation, and strives with every encounter to increase his own\
  \ legend, whether as scoundrel or saint. Perhaps the only creature he truly values\
  \ is his horse, Donahan. Exceedingly well trained, and having accompanied Alain\
  \ for longer than any of his human compatriots, Donahan represents everything Alain\
  \ looks for in a partner: absolute loyalty, absolute trust—and absolute obedience.</p>\
