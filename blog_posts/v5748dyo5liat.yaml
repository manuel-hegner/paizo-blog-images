  \    </div> \n    <p>I recently got a chance to develop an adventure written by\
  \ my good friend Brandon Hodge. It also turns out I got to develop an updated version\
  \ of an adventure that Brandon ran for our group nearly 10 years ago.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>Brandon has a solid background as a scholar of the esoteric and occult, and\
  \ after he was brought on as a consultant for <a href=\"/products/btpy9egu\"><em>Pathfinder\
  \ RPG Occult Adventures</em></a>, we knew that he'd be the best fit for an adventure\
  \ that would tie in to that book. After running the idea past him, he immediately\
  \ had an idea for the adventure pitch—one he knew well from years back. Since I've\
  \ been friends with Brandon since high school and since I'd been a player in that\
  \ adventure, it made me the best choice to develop it... and that adventure is <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy9grs\"><em>Pathfinder Module: The House on Hook Street</em></a>.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>Of course, the adventure has changed from when I was with my home group\
  \ back in Texas, and I think it's even better. I'll let Brandon get a few words\
  \ in about the history and process.</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"\
  description\">I remember that I sent a really disturbing nursery rhyme to my players\
  \ a few days before the first <em>House on Hook Street</em> sessions, and that it\
  \ was sometime around 2007. A few weeks previously, our group had one of those typical\
  \ post-game \"the thrill-is-gone/I've-seen-it-all/memorized-the-bestiary/bought-the-tshirt\"\
  \ laments that we've all felt at some point, and I recall another player boldly\
  \ challenged me for something truly fresh and surprising, but using existing materials.\
  \ So, I picked up the gauntlet.</p> \n     <p>And that's how <em>The House on Hook\
  \ Street</em> was born. The original adventure predated the Pathfinder RPG by a\
  \ couple of years, but it was still set in Golarion, though in the recently debuted\
  \ streets of Riddleport rather than Old Korvosa. Back then, my longtime pal Adam\
  \ Daigle and I were just enthusiastic players in a couple of weekly games in Austin,\
  \ and Daigle was just beginning to sniff around the industry, and trying to drag\
  \ me along with him. With his encouragement, I wrote this new adventure in the <em>Dungeon\
  \ Magazine</em> format with the intention that maybe—just maybe—I'd get it published.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>And because the re-write shifted the original plot enough that it isn't\
  \ spoiler material anymore, the mechanic I used to 'file off the serial numbers'\
  \ of monsters involved a bloodthirsty thieves' guild using tainted potions, with\
  \ transmogrifying results that let me use some of my favorite creatures in new and\
  \ horrifying ways, keeping my players guessing at every turn even as I was peering\
  \ menacingly from the other side of an open <em>Monster Manual</em>. It was part\
  \ of the challenge, after all, and I just went wild: thieves who \"overdosed\" on\
  \ tainted <i>elixirs of hiding</i> essentially used the stats for shadows but dragged\
  \ their discarded corpses behind them, while tainted <i>potions of gaseous form</i>\
  \ let other thieves exhale their souls as weird belker-things. Just don't ask me\
  \ about the poor sap that overdosed on a tainted <i>potion of tongues</i>—it's way,\
  \ way worse than you think, and, yes, the horrifying legacy of that encounter made\
  \ its way into the final product. See if you can spot it!</p> \n     <p>My players\
  \ went crazy trying to figure out what was happening, and I loved the results enough\
  \ to keep the adventure in my back pocket. When <em>Occult Adventures</em> came\
  \ along and Erik asked me to write an adventure using those materials, I knew I\
  \ finally had the perfect tools to bring the greater story to life. And by shifting\
  \ the setting to Korvosa, I got to revisit some of my favorite material from my\
  \ friend Nick Logue and the <em>Curse of the Crimson Throne Adventure Path</em>,\
  \ and I think you'll appreciate the results!</p> \n     <p>I recently ran the rewritten\
  \ adventure again as a playtest, with two members of that old group getting to revisit\
  \ <em>The House on Hook Street</em>. Sadly, Daigle couldn't join us, and just had\
  \ to deal with my constant updates and pictures of the action, some of which I've\
  \ included here. I'm happy to say my players were blown away with the adventure's\
  \ latest incarnation, and just as surprised with the twists and turns as their first\
  \ time through. That, and there's about 50 hours of gameplay packed in between these\
  \ covers, so I think you're getting your money's worth.</p> \n     <table class=\"\

  \  <p>One of the things I remember from that adventure long ago, aside from being\
  \ creeped out by Brandon's description of his reskinned antagonists, was getting\
  \ frustrated with getting to an enemy and just hacking through the floor. (I think\
  \ something might have even been on fire.) One of the things that I'll remember\
  \ about <i>this</i> adventure is getting to work on cool and creepy material from\
  \ Brandon while he sent me the aforementioned \"constant updates and pictures of\
  \ the action.\" I swear I got at least one email or text per page of adventure during\
  \ the process.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderModules/PZO9549-Introduction.jpg\"\
