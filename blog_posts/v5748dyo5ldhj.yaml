  \   </div> \n   <h1>Pathfinder Battles Preview: Bone Chiller</h1> \n   <p class=\"\
  date\">Friday, June 1, 2012</p> \n   <p>This week I'm revealing one more prepainted\
  \ plastic miniature from the upcoming <a href=\"/products/btpy8rqs\">Rise of the\
  \ Runelords</a> set in our <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids\"\
  >Pathfinder Battles</a> line produced in conjunction with WizKids. We're in the\
  \ home stretch now, with only a few miniatures left to reveal, so I'm slowing down\
  \ the pace a bit to make up for the explosion of early reveals over the last few\
  \ months. As my mother and work supervisors have always told me, I've got to learn\
  \ to pace myself.</p> \n   <p>So if it's to be only one miniature this week, it's\
  \ got to be something big and cool and scary. It's got to be something that, to\
  \ my knowledge, has never before been produced in prepainted plastic.</p> \n   <p>It's\
  \ got to be the Wendigo.</p> \n   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20120601-Wendigo.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20120601-Wendigo_180.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \   </div> \n   <p>The rare Wendigo appears late in the <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/riseOfTheRunelords\"\
  > Rise of the Runelords Adventure Path</a>, menacing the player characters as they\
  \ approach the campaign's endgame. The new hardcover <a href=\"/products/btpy8mqq\"\
  >Anniversary Edition</a> features lots of new illustrations, and a brand new shot\
  \ of the wintery Wendigo facing off against Valeros is one of my absolute favorites\
  \ in the new book. </p> \n   <p>Incidentally, printer samples of the Rise of the\
  \ Runelords Anniversary Edition hit my desk earlier this week, and it's fair to\
  \ say that not only is it one of the most beautiful Pathfinder products released\
  \ to date, it's one of the best-looking RPG books I've ever seen. And I'm not just\
  \ saying that because I love it like an only child.</p> \n   <p>A book of that quality\
  \ deserves really kick-ass minis to go along with it, and I think the Wendigo is\
  \ one of the most interesting and unique figures in the set. For starters, its Large\
  \ size allows it to tower over many of the other figures. That size gives the sculptors\
  \ more space to work their magic, so from the antlers to the severed leg stumps\
  \ (mounted in a clear plastic base to give a floating effect), this guy is packed\
  \ with interesting details. WizKids also outdid themselves on the Wendigo's paint\
  \ steps. Check out the creature's bloody hands! They even went so far as to apply\
  \ a shinier paint to the Wendigo's eyes, to give them a glassy, eerie look.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>He's awesome. And he's going to scare the pants off your player characters!</p>\
  \ \n   <p>We still have several more miniatures to reveal in the weeks leading up\
  \ to the set's August release. We'll have samples of the entire set on display at\
  \ <a href=\"/paizocon\">Paizo Con</a>, so if you're planning to head to that event,\
  \ prepare to bask in the set's glory in person. </p> \n   <p>I'll be there, and\
  \ so will the haunting Wendigo!</p> \n   <p>See you next week!</p> \n   <p>Erik\
