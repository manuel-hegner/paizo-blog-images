  \    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">The first chapter of the Strength\
  \ of Thousands Adventure Path, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq026li\"><em>Kindled\
  \ Magic</em></a>, is now available and contains an article describing nine students\
  \ who are the peers (and either friends or rivals) of the player characters. Several\
  \ teachers will be described in a similar way in the upcoming <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq027nz\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #172: Secrets of the Temple-City</em></a>. But students\
  \ and teachers aren’t the only important NPCs at a magic school. To help you further\
  \ populate the Magaambya, here are three other figures commonly encountered on campus\
  \ who didn’t make it into print due to space limitations. Enjoy!</p> <a href=\"\

  >Lumusi Yao, by Vlada Hladkova</p> \n     <p><b>Lumusi Yao (NG female human chef\
  \ 5)</b>: Head of the campus cooks, Lumusi is in charge of serving the masses of\
  \ hungry students and professors two meals a day. Lumusi stresses the importance\
  \ of a healthy menu over unhealthier items—though there are few who’d complain about\
  \ her goat pepper soup or spicy peanut curry. Lumusi also tries to keep the diversity\
  \ of the campus in mind, ensuring that catfolk researchers can avoid onions and\
  \ iruxi scholars get plenty of calcium. Despite her considerate demeanor, the chef\
  \ is something of a recluse, and it's an event among students whenever someone spots\
  \ her outside of the kitchens. Staff in the know whisper that Lumusi's skills came\
  \ from constantly cooking to care for her dying husband in his final days.</p> \n\
  \     <p><b>Thema (CG female elf gardener 6)</b>: An elf from a nearby Ekujae clan,\
  \ Thema helps tend to the many trees, plants, and gardens on the Magaambya campus.\
  \ While not the academy’s only gardener, she's the oldest and most experienced.\
  \ Thema can be seen in the late evening and early morning, silently tending the\
  \ grounds, leaving some to wonder if she ever rests or sleeps. She lets parts of\
  \ the grounds remain wild, but keeps the rest scrupulously tended. To most students\
  \ who casually interact with her, Thema is the picture of poise and grace—though\
  \ this evaporates outside of a natural setting, as students have caught her wildly\
  \ and elaborately cursing at sticky door-hinges or accidentally banging her shin\
  \ on university furniture. </p> \n     <p><b>Xhokan (LN male kobold inventory manager\
  \ 9)</b>: The ever-smiling Xhokan runs the student supply store, affectionately\
  \ referred to by Magaambya residents as “the Powderpile” for its large collection\
  \ of alchemical and magical powders. A rust-colored kobold with flecks of bright\
  \ orange on his scales, Xhokan is friendly but has a very wry sense of humor that\
  \ leaves some people unsure of what he actually means or feels. Xhokan ensures that\
  \ every student gets the supplies they need in order to complete their studies.\
  \ Xhokan also ensures no one gets any of these provided magical supplies off the\
  \ record—he has faced down the finest manipulators, beggars, and wheedlers the Magaambya\
  \ has to offer without budging on this point. Some students gossip they've spotted\
  \ the kobold doing inventory check after inventory check in the evening hours to\
  \ ensure nothing has vanished from his stores.</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left:\
