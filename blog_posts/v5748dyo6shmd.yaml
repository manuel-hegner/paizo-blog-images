  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Today, the International\
  \ Transgender Day of Visibility, we celebrate and recognize the lives of transgender\
  \ people in our gaming community. As several of the authors in today’s blog point\
  \ out, roleplaying games have a unique ability to let us explore, sometimes for\
  \ fun, sometimes to learn about ourselves, and often both at the same time. By continuing\
  \ to work to ensure that Paizo has transgender representation in our stories, and\
  \ our community, we hope to provide space and time for players and GMs, authors\
  \ and artists, partners and competitors, employees and fans, to be able to travel\
  \ through life’s journey, living, learning, growing, and of course, gaming.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The importance of this day, a day to acknowledge and celebrate trans\
  \ voices in our communities, is punctuated by recent political actions seeking to\
  \ prevent trans youth from receiving medical care, yet another attempt in a long\
  \ history to silence a group of people and strip away their humanity. This day is\
  \ highlighted by its relation to the Transgender Day of Remembrance (November 20th)\
  \ which honors the trans lives lost to violence, bigotry, and indifference. We hope\
  \ that this day of visibility can stand as a beacon of light and hope for the trans\
  \ people in all of the different roles in our gaming community: from colleagues\
  \ to contractors, players to partners. Wherever you are on your journey, we’re glad\
  \ to have you around the table to roll dice, tell stories, and make some truly fantastic\
  \ memories together.</p> \n     <p>Below are contributions from several of our transgender\
  \ community members, each focused on their personal truth and experience. Some of\
  \ these entries are raw and emotional. This is a very personal topic, and we support\
  \ our contributors in speaking genuinely about a subject that affects every part\
  \ of their lives. We thank them for taking the time to share their insight with\
  \ the wider community. </p> <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/5d96c141-7350-41cc-a478-5b5da2cb0301/033121_Medda.png\"\

  font-size: 13px;\">Art by Javier Charro</p> \n     <p>I’ve spent a lot of time playing\
  \ and making TTRPGs. When I first started playing Pathfinder regularly in 2013,\
  \ I already knew I was trans. It took me a while before I started playing explicitly\
  \ trans characters, since I was worried that people who played in my local area\
  \ wouldn’t be welcoming. Since then, the world has changed. While I still experience\
  \ transphobia, I’m more confident moving through the world as a trans person. Part\
  \ of this comes from having more stability in my life, but a big part is seeing\
  \ other trans people be able to live genuinely. Inclusion of trans characters in\
  \ Paizo books, particularly the wealth of characters in Lost Omens: Legends, often\
  \ starts with individual contributors deciding to push for more trans representation.\
  \ Representation can never replace having trans people creating and playing TTRPGs,\
  \ but it sends a clear sign that trans people are invited in. I live my life as\
  \ open as possible and include trans characters in my writing to let trans people\
  \ know they’re welcome, and to let people who are thinking about coming out as trans\
  \ see full, happy trans lives.<br> <em>Rigby Bendele, freelance author (they/them)</em></p>\
  \ \n     <br> \n     <p>I’m Alison Cybe, and I’ve been playing TTRPGs since 1993.\
  \ That makes me older than most types of fossils. I started early, when my parents\
  \ bought me one of TSR’s black box games for my birthday. Because of that, I’m one\
  \ of those people who will talk endlessly about how important a good starter set\
  \ is for a game. I was also one of those players who was always “happy” to play\
  \ a female character as well as a male one. I kinda noticed that a lot of players\
  \ in my local club were the opposite, but a few of us were content to “cross-RP,”\
  \ as it was called back then. I’ve not actually heard anyone call it that for years\
  \ now, which is good. Shows that we’ve moved on a lot. This means that, for me,\
  \ gaming provided a safe “fantasy space” to explore the way that gender is constructed\
  \ and perform as the type of woman I had always somewhat wanted to be. Over the\
  \ years, I've met a lot of trans and nonbinary people whose first avenues of exploration\
  \ were the same and ultimately lead to understanding their own identities. Because\
  \ of that, I always tend to be quite outspoken on the idea that trans characters\
  \ should be visible in games. There are no settings that don’t benefit from the\
  \ added diversity of characters, and the value that they give to the audiences outweighs\
  \ the upset that they cause to bigots (which is, in my honest opinion, an additional\
  \ bonus). The best way to do this is to create avenues for trans people to write\
  \ trans characters and subjects—in fact, publishers should do this with people of\
  \ every minority as much as possible. Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.<br> <em>-Alison\
  \ Cybe, freelance author (they/them) or (she/her)</em></p> \n     <br> \n     <p>I\
  \ know that “visibility” is an issue I’m supposed to care about. I know that it’\
  s the first step along the very, very long path toward you people treating us like\
  \ actual human beings, rather than aberrations. Honestly, though, this week? I really\
  \ couldn’t care less.</p> \n     <p>I’m supposed to use this blog to talk about\
  \ how including trans characters enriches a fictional world. They do, of course—\
  at bare minimum because trans people exist in the real world. To not include us\
  \ in your narratives, or in your games, is a quiet signifier that you really wouldn’\
  t mind if we were gone. Believe me when I say: trans people notice when you do this.\
  \ We put you on the list of cissies we don’t trust. And we all have a list. We have\
  \ to—you might kill us, after all. </p> \n     <p>Don’t believe me? Ask one of your\
  \ trans friends. You do have trans friends, right?</p> \n     <p>Personally, I’\
  d love to talk about examples of trans characters enriching fictional worlds—but\
  \ then, of course, I’d need some examples. Which examples should I use? The ones\
  \ where we’re monstrous, misogynistic villains, like in Silence of the Lambs? The\
  \ ones where we’re broken, made to suffer, in the hopes that you all might actually\
  \ start caring about our struggle, like The Last of Us Part 2? Or maybe softer ones,\
  \ like The Danish Girl, where you couldn’t even be bothered to cast an actress to\
  \ play the title role? Which disrespect would you like me to entertain?</p> \n \
  \    <p>(Perhaps you think I’m being unfair, by lumping you in with the others.\
  \ Can’t imagine what that’s like.)</p> \n     <p>I don’t know how I’m expected to\
  \ talk about how trans characters enrich a fictional world when I’ve almost never\
  \ seen a fictional world that let a trans character enrich it. I can count on one\
  \ hand the number of positive media representations of trans people that I’ve personally\
  \ witnessed, let alone enjoyed. But then again, this is just art imitating life:\
  \ as the Arkansas legislature so forcefully reminded us this week, you don’t want\
  \ trans people to enrich the real world, either.</p> \n     <p>I would love to be\
  \ proven wrong on this. But the operative word there is “prove.” This is the thing\
  \ that none of you seem to get: you have to prove it. By default, to protect ourselves,\
  \ I and other trans people have to assume you hate us. So prove us wrong. </p> \n\
  \     <p>Prove us wrong by writing us into your stories. Write us with rich inner\
  \ lives. Write us messy and flawed and full of joy. Write us full of hatred for\
  \ a world that hated us first. And then, when you’re done, pay a trans person to\
  \ tell you all the ways you got it wrong. Because you will get it wrong, and that’\
  s okay. What’s not okay is complacency in the face of that wrongness. Cis complacency\
  \ digs trans graves.</p> \n     <p>But sure. “Visibility.”<br> <em>-kieran tessa\

  \ Laranoa Harving, although I also go by the name Solatra Lilac Harvinkai, and I\
  \ am neither male nor female. That doesn't mean I lack a gender, although it does\
  \ for some, and I personally use nov/nov/novs/novself pronouns. For me, my experience\
  \ with gender was always one of looking up at the stars on dark nights in the countryside\
  \ and feeling at home, more so than I ever did in the house I lived in. I felt like\
  \ I was one with the stars for many years, in a way no other person I meet seemed\
  \ to resonate with. And as time went on, as I realized there was something else\
  \ to me than my mediocre life had implied, I discovered roleplaying games, and I\
  \ saw characters who expressed their gender more freely than I had, colorful gnomes\
  \ whose stats proudly declared them nonbinary! Spiteful dragons who dared to lack\
  \ a gender in a time when the roles forced upon us were clear and seemingly constant!\
  \ I also discovered Starfinder with its acknowledgment of the power the stars have:\
  \ fiery and passionate, cold and distant, a variation for every pinprick of light\
  \ in the sky, just like the people upon this world. I realized my gender was more\
  \ than an expression along a two-point scale; my gender was that of the stellar\
  \ world above and deserving to be acknowledged, embraced, and loved, just like every\
  \ other light above and every life below. So, when you call me, hear me: I am a\
  \ star.<br> <em>- Sasha Laranoa Harving, freelance author (nov/nov)</em></p> \n\
  \     <br> \n     <p>My name is Sol, short for Solomon, though you won’t see that\
  \ on any of Paizo’s products—yet. I hemmed and hawed a lot about taking part in\
  \ this blog as, compared to a lot of people here, I’m very new. I’ve only been at\
  \ Paizo for about six months. It’s my first job in the RPG industry, and the first\
  \ where I felt comfortable enough to publicly use they/them. It is, in fact, the\
  \ first place outside the internet where I’ve started taking steps to be visible\
  \ as who and what I am. These steps are not steady. To be visible to others, to\
  \ be known, and to admit that those who knew me maybe don’t—it’s scary. I think\
  \ lots of people with recently-cracked eggs feel the same way, even if they—like\
  \ me—have a good and trusted support network, and even if they—like me—have dabbled\
  \ with the thought of transitioning for years. Like others, I used RPGs to play\
  \ with gender long before I thought to apply those principles to myself. Recently,\
  \ though, it’s been the growing number of visibly trans, nonbinary, and just plain\
  \ queer characters in the gaming sphere and beyond that have bolstered my courage\
  \ and reaffirmed my intent. Every casual, singular “they” and genderless or trans\
  \ NPC that comes across my desk leaves me thinking, “I want that. Someday. And I\
  \ can have it, when I’m ready.” For those like me, who aren’t quite ready, that\
  \ representation offers comfort, lessons, and a promise. It reassures that there\
  \ has always been a place for us, a place that will wait until we’re ready to be\
  \ seen. So, this is me tilting my hand. I’m here. I’m almost ready. And for those\
  \ like me: I know you’re out there. Take all the time you need. We’ll see you.<br>\
  \ <em>-Solomon, Paizo staff (they/them)</em></p> \n     <br> \n     <p>Roleplaying\
  \ games helped me discover who I am. By being able to play different characters,\
  \ all with aspects of myself imbued within them, I have been able to discover more\
  \ about myself than I thought possible. Growing up, I’d play RPGs, video game and\
  \ tabletop, and I’d play powerful women doing amazing things as often as possible.\
  \ When I’d get stuck playing a “boy character,” I’d often just focus on mechanics\
  \ and ignore the character, or imbue these compulsory male heroes with stereotypical\
  \ traits, betraying my disingenuous view of masculinity. It wasn’t until a few years\
  \ ago that I started researching transgender women in order to properly write one\
  \ into an adventure. I found the experiences, thoughts, and feelings of these women\
  \ to be eerily like my own. It was then that I had the realization that I am trans.\
  \ My own journey of accidental self-discovery by writing a trans character into\
  \ an adventure inspired me to stay visible and keep trans characters visible in\
  \ our games. I hoped that it would help other people discover themselves by seeing\
  \ someone like them depicted in stories. And it has worked. I’ve heard from multiple\
  \ gamers that seeing a transgender character, written by transgender authors, has\
  \ lead them to self-acceptance and given them courage to confront the social norms\
  \ of our society and the roles that have been thrust upon us by the circumstances\
  \ of our birth. Representation matters. Being visible matters. It’s a small step,\
  \ but one that will lead us to a more peaceful and prosperous future.<br> <em>-Vanessa\
