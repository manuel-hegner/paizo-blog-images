  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">Friday, June 5, 2015</p> \n    <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"\
  > \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Whew! What a roller-coaster the last few weeks\
  \ have been here at Paizo HQ and beyond! Two weeks ago from this moment we were\
  \ deep in the throes of <a href=\"/paizocon\">PaizoCon 2015</a>, which is rapidly\
  \ earning a place in my heart as the best PaizoCon to date! It's always such a wonderful\
  \ experience getting to spend a weekend with Pathfinder players tossing dice and\
  \ throwing back beers, and this year's show was no exception.</p> \n     <p>Actually,\
  \ it was a bit of an exception in that the new, larger hotel space at the Doubletree\
  \ Hotel allowed for more focused gaming and a slightly more relaxed atmosphere,\
  \ conjuring memories of the earliest PaizoCons. I had a wonderful time chatting\
  \ about <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a> with fellow minis\
  \ enthusiasts, and from the attendee reports I've read so far, everyone on hand\
  \ seemed to appreciate the two full booster boxes of Pathfinder Battles figures\
  \ we packed in every attendee's goodie bag. These packs primed the pump for my favorite\
  \ PaizoCon event, Erik Mona's Miniatures Trading Afterparty, now in its SEVENTH\
  \ consecutive year.</p> \n     <p>This year I seeded the party with a few samples\
  \ from the forthcoming <a href=\"/products/btpy9bc6\"><em>Dungeons Deep</em></a>\
  \ set, which is now shipping to paizo.com customers and should be hitting retail\
  \ stores any day now. Folks were very positive about the new figures, and I was\
  \ very proud to show them off. <em>Dungeons Deep</em> is one of my favorite Pathfinder\
  \ Battles sets to date, and I'm confident you're going to really enjoy it.</p> \n\
  \     <p>PaizoCon was also special from a Pathfinder Battles perspective in that\
  \ I announced the very next set of Pathfinder Battles figures at the Preview Banquet—\
  <em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em>! I've long wanted to base a set loosely around a tavern\
  \ theme. Not only does it provide a great excuse to produce dungeon dressing suitable\
  \ for the tavern environment, but it also allows us to feature several NPC and even\
  \ player character-appropriate figures in a naturalistic way. Of course, <em>The\
  \ Rusty Dragon Inn</em> set will also include a nice mix of monsters, but we'll\
  \ get to those shortly.</p> \n     <p>Before that, however, let's preview the one\
  \ figure from <a href=\"/products/btpy9bc6\"><em>Dungeons Deep</em></a> that somehow\
  \ slipped through the cracks: the Anghazan Idol! Anghazan is an ape demon lord in\
  \ the Pathfinder campaign setting, and his blood-soaked idol—<a href=\"/products/btpy7uwp\"\
  >based on one of the first metal miniatures Paizo ever created back in 2006</a>—\
  seemed like a natural (ahem) fit for our first round of dungeon dressing.</p> \n\
  \     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150605-Group.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150605-Group_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>The Anghazan Idol comes complete with blood-stained\
  \ hands and cheeks, and works well as any primitive stone idol, either in a dungeon\
  \ or in the wilderness. I've teamed it up with a gaggle of dancing Charu-ka from\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy909j\"><em>Legends of Golarion</em></a> in the photo above\
  \ to put it in its proper context.</p> \n     <p>While out in the Sun, I noticed\
  \ the idol's special, somewhat secret feature. The green gem at the crown of the\
  \ idol is, in fact, translucent plastic, and it caught the light of the Sun in a\
  \ really interesting way (did I mention that I love summers in Seattle—these outdoor\
  \ dioramas will definitely be vanishing in a couple months as our weather turns\
  \ terrible). Check out the gem in particular in this close-up shot:</p> \n     <div\
  \ class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150605-Closeup.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150605-Closeup_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>Anyway, the Anghazan idol is, in many ways, the most\
  \ modest of the dungeon dressing in <a href=\"/products/btpy9bc6\"><em>Dungeons\
  \ Deep</em></a>, but I hope you'll discover that it's got a charm all its own. </p>\n\
  \     <h2>But what about the <em>Rusty Dragon Inn</em>?</h2> \n     <p>The big <a\
  \ href=\"/pathfinderbattles\">Pathfinder Battles</a> news out of PaizoCon was, of\
  \ course, <em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em>, currently set for release in the fourth\
  \ quarter of 2015! As I said, I've wanted to do a tavern-themed set for a long time,\
  \ and I'm thrilled with the characters, creeps, and critters we've been able to\
  \ fit into this set.</p> \n     <p>Ever since the line debuted, I've been trying\
  \ to balance the different requests I get from customers and retailers. Generally\
  \ speaking, super-collectors want stuff they don't already have, while retailers\
  \ (who often break boosters down for singles) say they want figures suitable for\
  \ player characters, since that's what their customers most often want to buy.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Well, the <a href=\"/pathfinderbattles/iconicHeroes\"><em>Iconic Heroes</em></a>\
  \ boxed sets are serving the need for straight-up heroes admirably (and sets 4,\
  \ 5, and 6 are currently in the works!), but that still leaves the need for NPCs.\
  \ But again, they should be NPCs that not everyone already has—a tall order after\
  \ 15 years of prepainted plastic figures.</p> \n     <p>Anyway, I think we did a\
  \ pretty good job making our selections. Honestly I'll be thrilled to have the figures\
  \ in <em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em> set for my own gaming, in which fights seem to\
  \ break out in taverns nearly as often as they do in dungeons!</p> \n     <p>Let's\
  \ take a quick look at many of the figures I revealed at PaizoCon, and get into\
  \ some of the whys and details I didn't have time to cover during my banquet presentation.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/RustyDragon-ServingGirl.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/RustyDragon-ServingGirl_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>No tavern set would be complete without a Serving Girl,\
  \ here with a tray laden with food and drinks. This figure takes inspiration from\
  \ Wayne Reynolds's cover to the <a href=\"/products/btpy8v3a\"><em>NPC Codex</em></a>,\
  \ and I can see plenty of uses for this figure—mostly involving getting caught in\
  \ an area of effect spell, but hey, that's tactically important too! The Serving\
  \ Girl is a Medium, common figure.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    \
  \  <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/RustyDragon-Merchant.jpg\"><img\
  \ src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/RustyDragon-Merchant_180.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>There always seems to be a Merchant lurking about in the\
  \ inn right before things go down, so he was another obvious inclusion in <em>The\
  \ Rusty Dragon Inn</em> set. Whether you use this guy as an NPC to be protected,\
  \ as an alchemist player character or adversary, or as a villain with an amazing\
  \ mustache to twirl, he's bound to make an impression on your players. The Merchant\
  \ is a Medium, uncommon figure.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a\
  \ href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/RustyDragon-CityWatchCommander.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/RustyDragon-CityWatchCommander_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>We've been doling out city watchmen for a long time\
  \ in the Pathfinder Battles line, and with <em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em>, we're\
  \ finally providing a no-nonsense commander. Decked out in the familiar blue from\
  \ previous watch figures, the City Watch Commander cuts an imposing figure, fists\
  \ on hips, ready to kick some ass. We based her look on Kasadei, a character from\
  \ both <a href=\"/products/btpy8rgh\"><em>Dawn of the Scarlet Sun</em></a> and the\
  \ <a href=\"/pathfinder/comics\">Pathfinder Comics</a> series, but she can really\
  \ be anyone you want, including a player character. The City Watch Commander is\
  \ a Medium, uncommon figure.</p> \n     <p>Of course, a set filled with nothing\
  \ by NPCs would likely doom the line, so I'm pleased to report that <em>The Rusty\
  \ Dragon Inn</em> also includes a bunch of monsters!</p> \n     <p>We've had really\
  \ good luck picking a couple of adversary types and providing multiple figures within\
  \ a set, and The Rusty Dragon Inn is no exception. This time, we're focusing on\
  \ monsters that, while not exactly welcome in an urban setting, certainly aren't\
  \ out of place there.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/RustyDragon-GhoulChampion.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static2.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/RustyDragon-GhoulChampion_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>The first focus race this time is GHOULS, one of my\
  \ all-time favorite fantasy races. Yes, we've done a few ghouls in previous sets,\
  \ but <em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em> allows us to plumb the pages of the <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9926\"><em>Monster Codex</em></a> in particular to present even more\
  \ ghoulish goodness. The Ghoul Champion depicted here, for example, is just one\
  \ of a small handful of amazing ghouls that we'll reveal over the weeks to come.\
  \ He's a Medium, rare figure.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"\
  //static2.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/RustyDragon-BugbearTyrant.jpg\"><img src=\"\
  //static2.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/RustyDragon-BugbearTyrant_180.jpeg\"></a>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>The set also focuses on bugbears, a staple humanoid enemy\
  \ race that has long been plagued by inconsistent or just flat-out unappealing figures.\
  \ Here we see the imposing Bugbear Tyrant, a Medium, uncommon figure.</p> \n   \
  \  <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150605-QuiveringCube.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderBattles/20150605-QuiveringCube_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n     </div> \n     <p>And, because I love you guys, here's a bonus reveal\
  \ that we didn't show off at PaizoCon. It's one of my favorite figures in the set,\
  \ a nasty, sticky… thing we can only call: the Quivering Cube. The Quivering Cube\
  \ is a Large, rare figure that comes complete with skeletal remains and some gear\
  \ visible within it. Hooray!</p> \n     <p>Lastly this week I'd like to mention\
  \ that the replacement figures for the badly produced Feiya and King Irovetti figures\
  \ that were originally going to appear in <a href=\"/products/btpy9bc6\"><em>Dungeons\
  \ Deep</em></a> have been moved to <em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em> instead. WizKids\
  \ simply wasn't happy with the quality of the figures, and they want to make them\
  \ as awesome as possible. I'm eager to see how they turn out.</p> \n     <p>And\
  \ that's it for this week, folks. Tune in next Friday for even more amazing reveals\
  \ of all-new figures from <em>The Rusty Dragon Inn</em>!</p> \n     <p>Erik Mona<br>\
