  ><em>Bestiary 6</em></a> is making the rounds and folks have had a chance to get\
  \ over the shock of seeing archdevils and kaiju and qlippoth lords and the Horsemen\
  \ of the Apocalypse and empyreal lords and all sorts of other powerful creatures\
  \ like the ones we spoke of last week, I'd like to thank humanity as a whole for\
  \ being such an endless font of inspiration. We've been creating monsters to fill\
  \ our stories and myths since we first started telling stories and weaving myths,\
  \ and over the thousands and thousands of years humanity's been around, well, that's\
  \ a lot of time to create a lot of monsters!</p> \n    <p>While there's always been\
  \ a core collection of monsters drawn from mythology in fantasy RPGs, the ones that\
  \ have appeared in print only scratch the surface. Whenever we start gearing up\
  \ for a new Bestiary, one of the first places we go to is real-world myth and legend.\
  \ <em>Bestiary 6</em> is no exception. From the very first monster in the book,\
  \ the blood-drinking alp, we drew from mythology to populate the book with a diverse\
  \ array of critters. As the book came together, I was amused to see a few unintentional\
  \ themes develop among these mythological monsters—I think my favorite is the \"\
  creepy monster with one eye.\" The ghole, the mapinguari, and the psoglav all come\
  \ from myth or cryptozoology, and it was a fun challenge for me to make sure that,\
  \ while all three are similar in theme (vaguely human-shaped one-eyed menaces),\
  \ they all fit different roles in the game.</p> \n    <p>Another theme that I was\
  \ delighted to finally explore in a Bestiary was no accident at all. The Wild Hunt\
  \ was one of the initial monsters I had in mind for the book, and for some time\
  \ was my go-to in house when folks would ask me \"Are there any monsters in this\
  \ book that I've heard of that aren't in print yet?\" or its variant, \"Are there\
  \ any monsters in the book that I'll be surprised HAVEN'T been put in one of our\
  \ products already?\" The Wild Hunt, which expanded from a single entry into several,\
  \ is a prime example—a well-known entire category of mythological monster that we've\
  \ done nothing with, until now. I love what Linda Zayas-Palmer did with these things,\
  \ and how the art ended up making them all look of a kind even when they include\
  \ such diverse shapes as horse, hound, or humanoid.</p> \n    <p>Of course, not\
  \ all of the monsters inspired by myth had one eye or were part of the Wild Hunt.\
  \ Check out the following three examples as proof! And I'm eager to see if folks\
  \ can pick out all of the other mythological monsters from the book in the comments\
  \ below!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1137-Euryale.jpg\"\
