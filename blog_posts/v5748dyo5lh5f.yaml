  \ You Didn't Know Were in the Strategy Guide</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday,\
  \ February 19, 2015</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"\
  description\">There have been a lot of questions and speculation on the messageboards\
  \ about what's going to be in the upcoming <a href=\"/products/btpy99sk\"><em>Strategy\
  \ Guide</em></a>, but now that it's set to (finally!) hit shelves next month, you'll\
  \ get to see for yourself. In anticipation of its debut, allow me to present a sneak\
  \ peek into 10 different features I bet you didn't know were in this book.</p> \n\
  \    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>1. Themes:</b><br> A theme gives you a ready-made\
  \ character concept, and a roadmap for building that character using the options\
  \ available in the <em>Core Rulebook</em>. If you want to play the sort of mysterious\
  \ druid who can call upon the land to rise up against her foes and the sky to strike\
  \ down those who threaten the natural world, the Fury theme will take you, step-by-step,\
  \ through building a character who can do those things, advising you on everything\
  \ from which race and feats to choose to which starting gear to purchase. If, on\
  \ the other hand, what attracts you to the druid class is the idea of playing a\
  \ character who shares an unbreakable bond of friendship and trust with a wild creature,\
  \ the Animal Friend theme will provide you with the advice you need to create that\
  \ character.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\" style=\"margin: 15px auto;\"\

  \ Animal Friend icon in the upper right-hand corner of the image? Keep an eye out\
  \ below for a glimpse into how it gets used throughout the <em>Strategy Guide</em>.</p>\
