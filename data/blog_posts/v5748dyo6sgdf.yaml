  \ gone by in a blur, with new surveys, updates, and playtest releases almost every\
  \ week! We know that this has been a challenging process for many groups, so we\
  \ wanted to take the moment to once again offer up our thanks. You've really worked\
  \ incredibly hard to give us the feedback we need to make this version of Pathfinder\
  \ be the best it can be.</p> \n     <p>This week we're taking a brief pause to catch\
  \ our breath. There's no new survey, no new update, and no new part of <a href=\"\
  https://paizo.com/products/btpya0ag?Pathfinder-Playtest-Adventure-Doomsday-Dawn\"\
  ><em>Doomsday Dawn</em></a> to talk about. In fact, we're getting close to the end\
  \ of the organized portion of the playtest, but that doesn't mean we're done. Far\
  \ from it! Keep working on your scenarios and turning in feedback. The more data\
  \ we have, the more certain we can be about the course we're taking.</p> \n    \
  \ <p>As for us here in the office, we've been hard at work these past months collecting\
  \ that data and using it to create a massive list of changes that we're in the process\
  \ of making to the game. It's an ongoing process, with everyone's comments and feedback\
  \ adding to the list nearly every day. Just the other day, we completed a huge examination\
  \ of the math behind much of the game and discovered a number of issues, based on\
  \ your feedback. This has been going on for a while and the results are something\
  \ that we're sure that you're going to like.</p> \n     <p>Well, we don't want to\
  \ tease you with spoilers too much just yet, but we can't wait to share more of\
  \ the final game with all of you!</p> \n     <p>Jason Bulmahn<br> <i>Director of\
  \ Game Design</i></p> \n     <p><i>Join the Pathfinder Playtest designers every\
  \ Friday throughout the playtest on our <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/officialpaizo\"\
