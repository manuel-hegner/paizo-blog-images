  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, December 2, 2009</p> \n   <p>In case you missed\
  \ <a href=\"/paizo/news/v5748eaic9mi8\">yesterday's announcement</a><a>, Paizo is\
  \ about to start the third annual </a><a href=\" /rpgsuperstar\">RPG Superstar </a>competition!\
  \ Hundreds of hopefuls will swarm the Paizo server with proposals for magic items\
  \ in Round 1, and Clark, Wes, and myself will read every single one of them in order\
  \ to weed out all but the Top 32. Because the submission deadline is January 1st,\
  \ that means we'll be working over the holiday break to get all of these done just\
  \ to make sure we aren't overwhelmed in the last two weeks of Round 1 judging—and\
  \ given how well the Pathfinder RPG is doing, we expect even more submissions than\
  \ last year.</p> \n   <p>The contestants put in a lot of work on their submissions\
  \ through the entire contest and do so under significant time pressure—in later\
  \ rounds, they only have three days to create their entry—and the judges take that\
  \ effort seriously. Clark, Wes, and I are living the dream (we get to work on RPG\
  \ products) and this contest is a way for other people to get their foot in the\
  \ door at doing the same thing. From Paizo's perspective, it's our way of finding\
  \ new talent. Many finalists from previous RPG Superstar competitions have gone\
  \ on to write for—or even work full-time for—Paizo and other game companies. We\
  \ want the best talent working for us, and this contest is one way for us to find\
  \ it.</p> \n   <p>The contest isn't easy. There are many challenges. And there's\
  \ always a twist. The winner is someone creative, able to follow directions, think\
  \ on his or her feet, and respond well to criticism. Do you have what it takes?\
  \ Do you have the \"designer chops\"? Check out the contest rules. Submit a magic\
  \ item. Expose your work to the critical eye of writing professionals and hundreds\
  \ of other gamers. I dare you to do your best. Heck, I dare you to do <i>better</i>\
  \ than your best.</p> \n   <p>And good luck to everyone who participates!</p> \n\
