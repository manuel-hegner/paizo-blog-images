The set is scheduled for a May release, and since time is short and our web team certainly wants to get out of here before Midnight, I'm going to keep today's preview short and very, very sweet by giving you your first good look at the set's limited edition "case incentive" figure: the <a href="/products/btpy92sa">Gargantuan White Dragon</a>!</span></p>

               <p>The Gargantuan White looks amazing in person. Captured in mid flight, the figure is taller than other dragons we've released so far, and every bit as menacing as his case incentive cousins, the <a href="/products/btpy8v08">Gargantuan Blue Dragon</a>, the <a href="/products/btpy91di">Gargantuan Skeletal Dragon</a>, and the <a href="/products/btpy909h">Gargantuan Green Dragon</a>. </p> 
               <p>As with previous case incentive figures, the <a href="/products/btpy92sa">Gargantuan White Dragon</a> will be produced in extremely limited quantities as a premium for customers who preorder a case of <a href="/products/btpy92s9">Reign of Winter</a> figures. Subscribers to the <a href="/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids">Pathfinder Battles</a> line receive a substantial discount on the figure, as well, so if you haven't yet <a href="/products/btpy8o6b">become a case subscriber</a>, please consider doing so!</p> 
               <p>That's it for me this week. See you next Friday for more exciting miniature reveals!</p> 
               <p>Until then, I remain,</p>

               <blockquote> 
                <h2 align="center">Chapter Two<br> The Quarry</h2> 
                <p class="body-drop-cap">The thwack of wood against wood jolted Jendara awake. She squeezed her eyes shut, but the sound reverberated throughout her whole head.</p> 
                <p>"I shouldn't have had so much of that lingonberry wine," she grumbled.</p> 
                <p>Wood cracked outside again. Jendara pushed back the furs and swung her feet over the side of her bed. She padded out into the hallway. Kran's door was open and his bed stood empty, his clothes missing from their hooks.</p> 
                <p>She sighed. He'd avoided her all day yesterday, and skipped the going-away feast. She shrugged on her sheepskin coat and trudged into the main room of the cottage.</p> 
                <p>"Kran?"</p> 
                <p>But he wasn't to be seen. His latest woodworking project sat on the plank table, the tools neatly in their case. A half-eaten slice of bread sat beside it. Jendara reached for her sword belt, hanging by the door, and buckled it on.</p> 
                <p>"Kran?" She opened the door. A swath of mist swallowed up the rest of the village. It cast a wintry pall over the summer morning, and Morul's house, just a few hundred feet away, was so shrouded in fog that it may well have been on the other side of the world. Fog was common here in the islands, but she never enjoyed the otherworldly cast it spread across the landscape, or the clamminess it left on everything.</p> 
                <p>With a sigh, she stepped out into the damp morning. Her toe squished on something wet and ropy on the doorstep, and she whipped her bare foot back.</p> 
                <p>It was the neck cord for Kran's slate. If the boy had taken it off, it was a sure sign he didn't want to talk.</p> 
                <p>Jendara's lips compressed. She didn't have the luxury of waiting around to settle this. In a few hours, the tide would change and she and the crew of the <i>Milady</i> would take their last trip to the mainland before winter's snow and ice hit. The thud resounded again, and she followed the sound to the back of the house.</p>

                </div> 
                <p>She rounded the corner of the little cottage and saw Kran's shape, the woad-blue sweater and shaggy black hair. He stood just past the wood-chopping block, his attention on a stick of firewood balanced on top of a fence post. His pants, she realized, cleared the top of his boots by a good half an inch. He was going to be tall, like his father. Like her father. The boy was made up of the best of both sides of his family.</p> 
                <p>She didn't know where the muteness came from. When he'd been littler, she thought it was something she'd done wrong before he'd been born. Maybe she should have made offerings to other gods beside Besmara, dark l0ady of pirates. Maybe she should have stayed on land instead of climbing so much rigging. But she'd never found a real reason for Kran's inability to speak, and she had to admit that as he'd gotten older, it didn't seem to matter much to the boy.</p> 
                <p>Kran wound up his sling and lobbed a shot at the firewood. It hit dead center and launched the wood far out into the mist.</p> 
                <p>Jendara clapped.</p> 
                <p>Kran spun around. His face, for one instant bright with his own success, went dark. He spiked two fingers toward his eyes, then pointed out over the fence line. The gesture spoke for itself: <i>See?</i></p> 
                <p>"I saw. You've got a nice release." She held out her hand. "Can I take a look at your shot?"</p> 
                <p>He reached in his coat pocket and held out a handful of wooden marbles. She rolled one between her fingers. It was smooth and heavier than it looked.</p> 
                <p>"You carved these?"</p> 
                <p>He nodded.</p> 
                <p>"Makes a world of difference, using shot that all weighs the same. Can really improve your aim." She tossed the marble in the air. "May I keep this? I need a good shooter if we play marbles on the ship."</p> 
                <p>He tapped his full belt pouch, suggesting he had plenty more.</p> 
                <p>"You still practice with rocks at all?"</p> 
                <p>He shrugged a shoulder.</p> 
                <p>"You should. What if you run out of shot while you're out hunting? Be sad to miss out on a really good snowshoe hare just because you forgot how to adjust for the weight of an off-balance stone."</p> 
                <p>At the word "hunting," his face crunched into a scowl. He reached for his chalk and board and made an exasperated sound when he realized he'd left it behind.</p> 
                <p>Jendara took a seat on an old driftwood log and patted the spot beside her. Kran didn't sit. "Look, I'm sorry I didn't take you hunting yesterday. I was afraid. Boars are trouble. I've heard of too many things going wrong on a boar hunt."</p> 
                <p>Kran was quick to tap his ear, then raise his eyebrow and point at his eye. He didn't know much of the sign language other mutes used, but he was good at finding his own ways to communicate.</p> 
                <p>"That's true: I've only ever heard stories, I haven't seen anything. But I know a man whose uncle—" She broke off, suddenly reminded of Yul's ridiculous story about the skinwalker. "Look, Morul's dog was almost killed yesterday. Hunting is dangerous."</p> 
                <p>Kran shook his pointer finger at her and then crossed his arms. He must have picked the gesture up from Yul over the last few summers spent ashore. She wondered, not for the first time, if perhaps she should have insisted the boy accompany her on trading journeys. He was the son of two sailors. He should practice his seamanship.</p> 
                <p>She reminded herself to focus on the problem at hand. Her son was angry. She had only a few hours before the tide turned and she set out on a two-month-long journey. She rubbed her head and wished it would stop aching.</p> 
                <p>She switched tactics. "You're going to be eleven in spring. That's pretty grown up." Really grown up. At age eleven, she'd gone with her father on her first raid, sailing to the mainland and stealing five sheep and a gallon of Chelish brandy. He'd let her drink it, too.</p> 
                <p>The boy kept his eyes on her face, his own expression guardedly neutral.</p> 
                <p>"If you can show me that you're ready for hunting big game, then I'll take you hunting with me. Maybe moose, down on Flintyreach. They're dangerous, but you haven't lived until you've made your own moose jerky."</p> 
                <p>He tapped his belt, beside his belt knife. She knew just what he meant.</p> 
                <p>"Yes, you'll get to take your own weapons. I'll even make you your own hunting spear. A good ash one, like my father made me."</p> 
                <p>Kran frowned and made a gesture with his hand like a half-closed fist, the thumb lifted. Jendara cocked her head, mimicking him. He repeated the gesture, raising the fist to eye level and giving it a little snap. She stopped in the middle of raising her own.</p> 
                <p>"No." She shook her head, even though it hurt. "My father didn't give me my belt axe. I took his when he died. To remember him."</p> 
                <p>Kran stepped over the scraps of wood and put his arms around her. She leaned her head against his. He normally considered himself too mature for babyish hugging.</p> 
                <p>He released her and beckoned toward the house. She got up off the log and paused a moment to brush wood chips off herself. Beyond her own small garden space, kept tended by Kran and Leyla, the fog was lifting. She could see all the way out to the harbor now, although the view was hazy. The <i>Milady</i>'s yellow-and-blue pennant already waved. She smiled a little. She'd bet a gold coin Glayn had raised it before the sun had even reached the horizon. The oldest member of the crew, the gnome loved the <i>Milady</i> as much as she did.</p> 
                <p>She scanned the path leading up to the village. A familiar figure was approaching, the ridiculous peacock feather in his felt cap bobbing along. Vorrin, of course. That must mean the <i>Milady</i> was ready to set sail.</p> 
                <p>Jendara waved at Vorrin. She was happy to see him, even if she wasn't ready to leave Kran just yet. But she knew a good way to buy a few more minutes with her boy. "Kran!" she called. "How would you like pancakes for breakfast?"</p> 
                <p>"Pancakes?" Vorrin asked. "You know I can't resist pancakes." He gave Kran a friendly punch in the shoulder.</p> 
                <p>The boy punched him back with a grin. Vorrin slung his arm around Kran's shoulder. "You sure you don't want to go with us? We're going to swing south a bit to meet Boruc—he's Morul and Yul's brother, and some kind of hermit-artist-genius. He lives in a mine."</p> 
                <p>"A quarry," Jendara corrected. She stooped to gather up Kran's slate and pass it to him. "I guess he lives in Averaka most of the year, but in the summer, the quarry reopens and he goes out to get first dibs on the best stone. Yul says all Boruc does is carve rock, drink mead, and chase wo—" She eyed her son. "Chase parties," she corrected herself. "He likes to have a lot of fun."</p> 
                <p>"Maybe we're glad you're not going," Vorrin said. "Boruc doesn't sound like a very good influence."</p> 
                <p>Kran rolled his eyes. <i>Boats are boring, and so are statues</i>, he wrote.</p> 
                <p>Jendara ruffled his hair. "I love you, Kran."<i></i></p> 
                <p><i>You, too,</i> he wrote. <i>Pancakes???</i></p> 
                <p>Vorrin laughed. "It's good to know the lad's mind is in the right place."</p> 
                <p align="Center">∗ ∗ ∗</p> 
                <p>Flintyreach, one of the largest islands in the Ironbound Archipelago, lived up to its name. Off the <i>Milady</i>'s bow, the gray rock of the island's bones stretched down to the water, no softness of soil or grass to invite a sailor off her boat. A few stunted shrubs sprang up out of the cracks in the rock. But although these plants were small, Jendara felt certain she'd never seen any such a happy green. The people of the islands were like that: a hardscrabble lot, quick to fight, but quicker to reach for the mead. Every day was a celebration when you worked so hard to survive.</p> 
                <p>"I can't see why Yul's brother wants to live in a place like this," Vorrin said, leaning his elbows on the deck railing beside her.</p> 
                <p>She reached into her pouch for a bundle of leftover pancakes and passed him one. "Boruc's a stoneworker."</p> 
                <p>"He could go anywhere to find stone." Vorrin waved at the gray expanse. "There aren't even trees here."</p> 
                <p>Jendara pointed to the south, where greenery climbed up the steep flanks of Flintyreach's inner hills. "The beaches look harsh, but most of Flintyreach is forested. Unfortunately, the interior is also infested with trolls, giants, and ettins. The folk down in the villages organize hunting parties, but it's still dangerous. People stay close to the sea here. It's safer."</p> 
                <p>The<i> Milady</i> began to swing around, preparing for its approach to the docks. In a few minutes, the ship was tied up and the twelve-man crew ready to explore the little fishing village of Alstone—or at least, its tavern. Vorrin consulted with Tam, the big blond first mate who'd grown up on Flintyreach, and then met Jendara at the edge of town, where a little cart road ran off toward Alstone Quarry.</p> 
                <p>"Tam says he and the crew will pick up our other trade goods, so there's no rush to get back to town." He eyed the sun, about three fingers above the horizon. "But let's try to be back by nightfall."</p> 
                <p>Jendara nodded. Morul claimed there hadn't been any major problems with giants or trolls in this part of Flintyreach lately, but she didn't want to risk a run-in. Wild animals were bad enough, but giants...Jendara could definitely live without running into any of them.</p> 
                <p>As the cart road snaked away from the shoreline, the scrubby trees grew taller and the undergrowth thicker. Still, the place didn't feel anything like Sorind, the island she'd just left behind. The trees here had grayer bark and twisted limbs. They did little to soften the wind coming off the ocean.</p> 
                <p>Jendara glanced over at Vorrin. He had gone quiet, his teeth working the edge of his mustache like he did when he was worried. She watched him a minute longer.</p> 
                <p>"All right, what's bothering you?"</p> 
                <p>"Nothing. It's just getting awfully late in the season."</p> 
                <p>"It'll be fine," she said. "Sure, we've had a busy summer and it's kept us moving more than usual. Maybe we're a few weeks behind, but it's no big deal. And you've been wanting more variety in our trade goods. Boruc's carvings might be just the moneymaker you've been looking for."</p> 
                <p>He sighed. "I understand the logic, but that doesn't make me any more comfortable. We playing it close this trip, Dara. You and I both know summer fades fast out here."</p> 
                <p>She gave him a particularly winsome smile, one that rarely failed to soften him. "This is our last stop before we leave for Varisia. We'll be fine."</p> 
                <p>"It's going to make for a hard trip back to Sorind, and you know it. That's why you've been so awkward with Kran. Because you're worried."</p> 
                <p>"I'm not worried, and I haven't been awkward." She paused, her eyes scanning the brush. "Did you hear something?"</p> 
                <p>Vorrin shook his head. "No. It's perfectly quiet."</p> 
                <p>"Now it is. But just now, I thought..." Jendara trailed off. She sniffed at the air, but smelled only smoke and the faint scent of roasted meat. "We must be getting close to the quarry."</p> 
                <p>"I hope Boruc's work is as good as Yul claims it is. Our shipment this fall is too ordinary. Too many furs and wines, not enough ivory. If we could get some walrus—"</p> 
                <p>Jendara cut him off with a wave of her hand. "Hush." She listened for a long moment, head cocked. "Don't you think it's too quiet?"</p> 
                <p>He didn't answer. There were no birds calling, no squirrels rustling the branches. Jendara broke into a run. Vorrin hurried after her.</p> 
                <p>The road tilted downhill. A few ruts showed where carts loaded with rock must have dug into the surface, and Jendara avoided them, glad it hadn't rained lately. The smell of smoke intensified, as did the heavy smell of roasted meat.</p> 
                <p>Vorrin grabbed her shoulder. "Wait."</p> 
                <p>"What?"</p> 
                <p>"It's a long time till dinner. Why would anyone be cooking right now?" He shook his head. "Something feels wrong."</p> 
                <p>"We should be careful." Jendara moved closer to the edge of the road, ready to dive into cover at any moment. She crept forward.</p> 
                <p>A crow exploded from the bush in front of her, its scream launching her backward. She fell onto her backside and pushed herself away. The crow rose up, cawing once, twice as it cleared the treetops.</p> 
                <p>Vorrin helped her to her feet. "You okay?"</p> 
                <p>She nodded.</p> 
                <p>They moved forward again. The cart road turned a sharp corner. Jendara and Vorrin stopped, staring down at the encampment at the edge of the quarry. Nothing moved.</p> 
                <p>"It's too quiet," Jendara murmured.</p> 
                <p>"Jendara," Vorrin whispered. He pointed.</p> 
                <p>Beside a cart, a man stood awkwardly, head hung low, arms behind him, legs too straight. It took her a minute to make sense of the strangeness of his pose, to see the stake running through him, lifting his feet inches off the ground. To see the black puddle beneath, clotted with flies.</p> 
                <p>A crow settled on his shoulder and nipped at his cheek.</p> 
                <p>"No!"</p> 
                <p>Even as she ran, she knew it was stupid, knew it couldn't change anything. But she couldn't just watch the bird eat his face. Her sword jumped into her hand.</p> 
                <p>"Jendara!"</p> 
                <p>The bird fluttered aloft, but the sword was already swinging, already biting into its neck. For a second, the crow hung in the air, eyes fixed on her face. Then its head soared out over the brink of the quarry. Its body fell to her feet.</p> 
                <p>"Damn it, Jenny!" Vorrin spun her around by the elbow.</p> 
                <p>"Don't call me <i>Jenny</i>." She shook him off and began pacing, too upset to hold still. "I've seen this before."</p> 
                <p>"We need to scout out the camp," Vorrin said, keeping his voice low. "We need to know if there are any survivors."</p> 
                <p>"Or worse, any attackers." She took a deep breath, regaining a little control. "You're right, we need to go through the whole place."</p> 
                <p>"Do a quick perimeter check. I'll head west, you go east. And don't take any chances." He reached out for her, brushed his fingers against her cheek. "I don't like this."</p> 
                <p>"Me neither," she whispered, but she was already turning away from him. She still couldn't hear any sounds save for her own footsteps crunching the gravel underfoot. That was bad.</p> 
                <p>She sank into her hunter's crouch and approached the nearest building, the largest around. The presence of a tin stovepipe suggested it might be the kitchen and mess hall for the quarry workers. Jendara pressed her ear to the wall and listened hard. Still quiet, save for a faint drip-drip-dripping. She wished she could look through the window, but the shutters were closed.</p> 
                <p>Jendara's fingers trembled as she reached for the doorknob.</p> 
                <p>She snapped open the door and almost staggered backward at the overpowering stench of blood and offal. The kitchen looked like a scene from a nightmare. Bloody handprints covered the counters. Flies buzzed over raw-looking heaps that she didn't want to name, and blood slicked the floor. Jendara swallowed hard and took a step inside.</p> 
                <p>"Is there anyone here?"</p> 
                <p>She didn't know why she called out, except in the faint hope that someone hiding might hear her and come out to explain that this was all a joke, this was all animal blood, those weren't human intestines curled around that sack of onions, there was nothing horrible in the big pot sitting on the stove. She kept her grip on her sword, but her knees wobbled a little as she picked her way across the room. She had to look. Had to know. She peered over the lip of the pot.</p> 
                <p>It was empty.</p> 
                <p>Jendara sagged. She had expected...she shook her head. Silly perhaps. Whatever happened here, it must have happened fast, and whoever did it hadn't stopped to cook. They weren't that civilized. She knew they weren't that civilized.</p> 
                <p>After all, she'd seen this before.</p> 
                <p>She shook her head and pushed forward.</p> 
                <p>A door opened up into the dining hall, and she stepped out into the space. The dripping was louder here. With only a few windows, the big room was almost too dark to see into, but she saw enough. Something squelched under her boot as she crossed to the nearest table and righted a bottle of milk. The puddle on the table kept dripping, a soft slow pattering onto the tin mug lying on its side on the floor.</p> 
                <p>The door burst open. Sunlight poured in, lighting up a long sweep of blood leading outside. Vorrin stopped in the doorframe. He took in the empty room. "I see you forgot we were just circling the perimeter. Any survivors in here?"</p> 
                <p>Any survivors. Such a flat way to say the worst. She shook her head. "It's empty. Just blood and parts."</p> 
                <p>The dripping stopped.</p> 
                <p>"This must have just happened," she realized. "A lot of this blood is still wet. And the milk bottle couldn't have been knocked over more than a few minutes ago."</p> 
                <p>"We must have scared someone away. A looter, maybe. From what I saw, I think most of this was done longer ago. Maybe this morning."</p> 
                <p>"Most of what?" Her voice sounded faint even to her own ears. An attack at dawn. That was what happened on Crow's Nest, her father's island. Her sister's island. She thought of the man tied to the stake and felt sure it was no coincidence. She stiffened her shoulders. "Show me."</p> 
                <p>They stayed silent as Vorrin led her around the side of the nearest building, passing by a clothesline with a few limp garments hanging in the still air. An open door showed a basket of dirty shirts and a washtub. Ordinary items in an ordinary washhouse.</p> 
                <p>They rounded the corner. A heap of bodies lay ahead, a raw mound of broken and bloody dead.</p> 
                <p>"Gods," she breathed. "That has to be eighteen or twenty men."</p> 
                <p>Vorrin circled around the pile. "Some of these bodies don't look...whole."</p> 
                <p>"What?"</p> 
                <p>He waved her over. Jendara knelt to look at a body on the bottom of the stack. She was glad she couldn't see his face; only his feet and legs stuck out—or more aptly, his mutilated legs and <i>foot</i>. Jendara's stomach twisted. "Is it just me, or do his legs look like the meat's been cut off in strips?"</p> 
                <p>"I don't want to think about it." He pointed to the remains of a small campfire. "Someone definitely built a fire here, like they stayed a few hours."</p> 
                <p>Jendara stooped to hold her hand above the ashes. She nudged a flat rock in the center. "Still warm, and if I had to guess, I'd say those were grease stains on this stone."</p> 
                <p>Vorrin blanched. "I don't want to think about it," he repeated. He pressed his fist to his mouth, skin pale.</p> 
                <p>Jendara felt her own gorge rise, but swallowed hard. "We should check out the rest of the camp."</p> 
                <p>She moved to the next building, a woodshed. Jendara freed her sword to circle it. Behind her, Vorrin moved quietly, only the occasional crunch of gravel giving away his movement. There was no blood in the woodshed.</p> 
                <p>Jendara steeled herself to walk past the mound of dead again, but Vorrin caught her eye. He tapped his ear and nodded toward the gaping pit of the quarry.</p> 
                <p>She listened. She heard nothing at first, but then caught a small sound: a scrape of leather against stone. "Do you think it's our milk spiller?" she whispered.</p> 
                <p>He nodded. They crept toward the cart road. As they passed behind the washhouse, Jendara felt a momentary gratitude that its bulk hid the grisly mound, a feeling which passed all too quickly was the tiny sound of a foot crushing gravel caught her ear. There really was someone down there. She wondered how deep the quarry went and tightened her grip on her sword.</p> 
                <p>The cart road led to the rim of the quarry—a deep stony bowl cut out of the hillside. It stretched a good quarter of a mile across. Jendara peered over the edge. The narrow track continued down into the rocks, following the curve of the walls. For the first hundred yards or so, mounds of yellow sandstone lay piled up on the shoulders of the road. Trees and brush obscured the turn beyond. Jendara leaned out farther. The bottom of the quarry looked empty, the flat expanse of sea-green stone like a placid lake.</p> 
                <p>Jendara turned back to Vorrin. "Whoever went down there, they haven't reached the bottom yet."</p> 
                <p>He glanced over the edge. "I don't like that descent. It's too easy to rig an ambush on a road like this."</p> 
                <p>Jendara laid her hand on his arm. "<i>If</i> the person we're chasing is dangerous. This could be a survivor, scared out of their mind after what they saw back there. Or it could be a witness, some woodsman who just walked into a nightmare. No matter who they are, I want to talk to them."</p> 
                <p>"Let me go down."</p> 
                <p>"No. I'm a local, they're more likely to trust me." Jendara pointed to the far side of the quarry. "I think you'd better follow the top of this cliff around to the far side. The ground's rough, but I think that looks like a footpath leading out of the quarry, don't you?"</p> 
                <p>Vorrin squinted a moment. "I see it. Good plan." He gave her a sharp look. "You'll be careful, right? You're not running down there with your sword half-out just because of what you saw back there?"</p> 
                <p>Jendara began walking down the steep path without sparing him a backward look. "I know I'm doing, Vorrin. Just watch the trail."</p> 
                <p>As she went, she studied the path ahead for clues. There was no way to make out tracks on gravel this heavily traveled, but blood would stand out. No way to kill that many people without getting bloody. And it was hard not to leave tiny signs of passage that a good set of eyes might pick up: with every step, a person shed spoor like hairs and threads and fragments of the foods they ate.</p> 
                <p>She paused to listen for other footsteps. The quarry was silent. Jendara took a few steps forward, focusing on the sound of the gravel beneath her boots. She knew how to step lightly, but the tiny stones made a certain amount of noise no matter what. She paused again. <i>There</i>. That might have been the rustle of a foot passing over pea gravel.</p> 
                <p>She resisted the urge to run toward the sound. It would be all too easy to think of those bodies piled up by the wash house and let hot rage whip her into a run, but she pushed the anger aside. If she ran toward a survivor, it would only further terrify the poor man or woman. And if it was a killer, well, it would still be just as easy to die by falling to the bottom of this pit as it would be to get jumped by a slavering cannibal.</p> 
                <p>Cannibalism. Just the thought of it sickened her. The only cannibals she'd ever heard of were the Kalvamen, those reclusive island dwellers far to the north. Few risked the trip to Kalva to see the massive barbarians with their milk-white eyes and sickening eating habits, and no Kalvamen had raided the islands in generations. Morul and Yul weren't the only ones who thought the Kalvamen were nothing to fear. If asked, most islanders would agree that the people of Kalva were too deranged and inbred to manage a sea crossing.<i></i></p> 
                <p><i>Maybe they should be more afraid</i>, Jendara thought. After she'd returned home that day to find her father dead and her sister missing, she had taken to her ship and scouted the island of Kalva from the sea. It was true she had seen no sign of ships large enough to travel the ferocious seas between Kalva and the Ironbound Archipelago, but it was also true that plenty of islanders had sailed remarkable distances in small raiding vessels. She had never discounted the Kalvamen just for lack of seafaring ability.</p> 
                <p>She tripped on a stone jutting out of the worn path, and at the last second caught herself on a massive boulder. She clung to it a moment, trying to catch her breath. She needed to pay better attention if she didn't want to kill herself.</p> 
                <p>A few feet beyond her, someone had cleared away the piles of fallen rock and brush, and she could clearly see the bottom of the quarry. The current work zone stood out from the rest of the rock floor, with racks of gear and tools stacked around a square perimeter. Piles of rock sat waiting to be loaded onto carts. Jendara knew little about stones or masonry, but thought the green stuff might be soapstone. It was always in high demand, being easy to work.</p> 
                <p>The hairs on the back of her neck prickled. All those piles provided easy cover for an ambush.</p> 
                <p>She picked her way forward and kept low to the ground as she came out into the flat stone-working area. A massive chunk of green rock sat beside the edge of the path. There was no way to see behind it.</p> 
                <p>Jendara brought out her handaxe. She pressed her back to the stone and reminded herself that whoever was down here might not be a white-eyed cannibal killer.</p> 
                <p>"I don't want to hurt you," she called out. "I just want to talk."</p> 
                <p>No reply.</p> 
                <p>She threw herself around the side of the stone with her axe ready. She saw no one.</p> 
                <p>The jolt of unused adrenaline made her legs go to jelly. She ignored it, kept her axe at the ready, and began to walk the perimeter of the quarry. She'd expected the worst. It felt strange not to face a monster when she was ready for one.</p> 
                <p>She stopped. She'd reached the side of the quarry bottom almost directly below its entrance, and a dark blot lay on the ground. The crow's head she'd lopped off at the top of the quarry. An ant crawled over the still-glossy bead of its yellow eye.</p> 
                <p>She had to avert her gaze. Beheading the crow had been a bad idea. She'd been raised to uphold the old clan traditions, and the crow had been her clan's totem. Life at sea had been one way to escape the bird's constant presence on dry land—the only time she had to look at them was when the ship docked, or when she saw someone wearing one of those crow-shaped traveler's pendants. She tried not to look at those necklaces for too long. She'd bought one once for Kalira, her sister. The younger girl had adored it.</p> 
                <p>Jendara had circled most of the way around now, and still hadn't seen anyone. Where was the person who'd gone down into the quarry?</p> 
                <p>Above her, something scraped. Jendara looked up and swore. She'd missed the entrance to the little footpath, and now her prey was escaping up it.</p> 
                <p>"Vorrin!" She had to warn him.</p> 
                <p>But a roar answered her shout: the rumble of something huge rolling down the hill. Vorrin might not be in danger, but she was.</p> 
                <p>She somersaulted over the soapstone block, pressing her face against its rough surface. Dust filled the air. She couldn't see. Or breathe. The soapstone shuddered as something massive hit it and stone shards rained down on her. Jendara hissed as one pierced her sleeve and drove into her forearm.</p> 
                <p>Coughing, she managed to get to her feet. Chunks of rock lay all around the soapstone block. If she hadn't moved behind it, she would have been crushed.</p> 
                <p>She scanned the trail above. Dust obscured all details. She was going to have to climb it blind.</p> 
                <p>Jamming her axe back into her belt, she scrambled forward. The ground was steep, the yellow sandstone of the main cliff walls unstable. She kept sliding backward in the stuff. Jendara grabbed for a handhold and dug her fingers into a gnarled root. The dust was clearing.</p> 
                <p>Something dark moved up ahead.</p> 
                <p>Jendara reached for the next handhold. Until she got her feet under her, she didn't dare try to attack the thing. She had a good arm, but on a nearly vertical path, the odds of her hitting him with her handaxe were small. She pulled herself up over a knoll of solid stone and caught her breath.</p> 
                <p>There he was. A man—a tall man in a long, shaggy cloak—hurried up the trail. He pulled himself up the steep hillside, snatching at the branches of the overhanging trees like rungs on a ladder.</p> 
                <p>"Hey!" she shouted, and reached for her belt axe. She'd never really believed she was chasing was an innocent bystander, but the man's grace and mass made his guilt a near certainty in her mind. No islander would have just stood by to watch his friends be ripped apart and eaten, not unless he was sick or crippled.</p> 
                <p>He leaped forward and disappeared between a pair of bushes. A rock as big as Jendara's head rolled out of the brush, bouncing and tumbling straight toward her.</p> 
                <p>"Damn it!" She threw herself aside and skidded on the path. She caught herself on a tree and raced up the hill.</p> 
                <p>Up above, Vorrin gave a sudden shout of surprise. Jendara hurried, but by the time she reached the top, Vorrin was just picking himself up, pinching a bloody nose and swearing.</p> 
                <p>"It got away," he growled. "I turned away for a second—I thought I heard something behind me—and it jumped me. Looked like a bear."</p> 
                <p>Jendara shook her head. "A bear? I was following a man. A big man, but a man."</p> 
                <p>Vorrin shrugged. "It happened fast, and there was a lot of dust in the air. Could have been a man, I guess. But it looked furry. And it had claws." He held out his hand. A gash ran down the back of it.</p> 
                <p>Jendara looked out into the forest. Some kind of trail continued into the forest, but here the trees were thick and the bracken dense. If anything wanted to disappear out here, it would. And back at Alstone Village, the crew of the <i>Milady</i> were waiting.</p> 
                <p>"Let's get out of here," she said. "Someone should know about this."</p>

              <div itemprop="articleBody"> <span itemprop="description">As we keep marching toward the May release of the <a href="/products/btpy92s9">Reign of Winter</a> set of <a href="/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids">Pathfinder Battles</a> prepainted plastic figures, I want to take a little break from the usual parade of monsters and creepy creatures to focus on four figures that work great to model player characters, even if that was not their original intent.</span>
               <p></p> 
               <p>One of the coolest things about basing some of our sets on our popular <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath">Pathfinder Adventure Path</a> range is that it gives us a chance to include a lot of NPCs. Sometimes, said NPCs are ancient crone queens and winter witches, but lots of other times they're adventurers—making them perfect minis to represent your player characters. Reign of Winter has a few such figures, and this week I'd love to show them to you.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_PaleTowerGuard_500.jpeg"> <img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_PaleTowerGuard_180.jpeg" border="0"> </a>
               </div> 
               <p>Here's hoping your player character looks a little bit like a guard in a winter fortress. If so, you'll appreciate the Pale Tower Guard, a heavily armored warrior type drawn from the pages of the very first <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/reignOfWinter">Reign of Winter</a> adventure. In that adventure, the Pale Tower Guards go door to door looking for the rebel Nadya Petska, bringing them into conflict with the player characters. The Pale Tower Guard is a Medium, common figure.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_Nadya_500.jpeg"> <img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_Nadya_180.jpeg" border="0"> </a>
               </div> 
               <p>Speaking of Nadya Petska, she's also included in the set, and she makes for one of the most gorgeously produced female adventurer figures in the whole <a href="/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids">Pathfinder Battles</a> range. Because she's such a great figure, and because the rare slots are mostly filled with even weirder creatures and NPCs, I decided to slate Nadya Petska into the uncommon rarity. She is a Medium figure.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_Greta_500.jpeg"> <img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_Greta_180.jpeg" border="0"> </a>
               </div> 
               <p>Nadya isn't the only awesome female warrior in the set. Here we have Greta, a powerfully built barbarian who just happens to be the human form of a Winter Wolf. She also happens to be a sweet figure for a human warrior or barbarian player character. Greta is Medium, and is also uncommon. Some of you will no doubt think that some of these figures should be rares, but I promise you the rares in this set are CRAZY, and most of them don't make a ton of sense to have in quantity. </p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_Ratibor_500.jpeg"> <img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_Ratibor_180.jpeg" border="0"> </a>
               </div> 
               <p>Our last figure this week is Ratibor the Bold, a human barbarian who betrayed the witch queen Baba Yaga and who has been cursed to guard her Dancing Hut forevermore. With a bow, shield, axe, and armor, he also doubles as a villain, player character, or even a mook. This Medium figure is slated at the uncommon rarity.</p> 
               <p>And that's it for this week. Next week I think I'll unleash some of the rares to provide a bit more perspective on why I decided to make most of these guys uncommon. It will all make perfect sense shortly, as we depart the time and space of Golarion to check out some of the set's truly WEIRD figures.</p> 
               <p>Until then, I remain…</p>

               <p>A few years ago, James Sutter asked me if I would write a short story for Pathfinder. I'd never played, but the world sounded amazing and like a good fit for me, so I dove into Golarion and tried very, very hard to come up with a character to have adventures there. I knew I'd have to create someone I could both like and really believe in, and I knew it wasn't going to be easy. But then Jendara, the hero of the short story <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinder/tales/serial/motherBears">"Mother Bears"</a> and my upcoming novel, <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90bk"><i>Skinwalkers</i></a>, walked into my bathroom without even knocking.</p> 
               <p>That's exactly her style. Unlike most of the characters I've written, Jendara sprang into my mind fully formed. She just showed up with her handaxe and a belt pouch crammed full of the kinds of snacks and survival supplies that every traveling mom has to carry, and she perched on the edge of the bath tub (that's where I brainstorm, in the bath tub), and said "I can't be a pirate anymore, but being on the right side of the law ain't easy." Just like that, I knew that her family was gone and her husband had been murdered by another pirate and that this woman was going to have a hard time making a new life for herself. She was going to need me.</p> 
               <p>I feel very lucky that James believed in Jendara and gave me a chance to write her first story, but I feel even luckier that the Pathfinder community decided this tattooed, short-fused woman was somebody they liked, too. After "Mother Bears," there was a lot of positive feedback on the Paizo forum and places like Twitter. People reached out to me to let me know that they thought an ex-pirate single mother was pretty great—and that a novel about her would be just the kind of adventure they were looking for. It was a tremendous experience, and I am utterly thankful to the Pathfinder community for being so supportive and welcoming.</p> 
               <p>I loved writing <i>Skinwalkers</i>. There's a lot of scary and horrible stuff packed into its covers, but there's a lot of wonder and beauty, too. My fingers are crossed that when people see more of Jendara, they will continue to enjoy and believe in her.</p> 
               <p>As for me, since I wrapped up the novel, I've been enjoying a little time away from my larger-than-life creation. I've started playing Pathfinder, although I'm still a rank novice. I like it a lot—and my bumbling cleric character is a totally different kind of woman from Jendara. She at least knocks before barging into the bathroom.</p>

              <h2>Chapter 4: Essence of the Hunt</h2> 
              <div itemprop="articleBody"> 
               <p><span itemprop="description">At the warning cry, Aberny looked back and noticed the crude frame of branches that propped a large rock pile above the tunnel they'd emerged from. Even as he did, a scrabble of talons alerted him just before the beast burst upward, jaws snapping every which way. It clamped onto the ledge with one claw and swept the other out.</span></p> 
               <p>Ralynn jumped away, but the claw tore out the supporting branches instead, dropping the pile in a dust-raising crash and sealing off any escape. The chimera fell back to the floor, crunching Tali's bone sculpture beneath its feet as she scrambled for cover.</p> 
               <p>Ralynn leapt to the ground after it, whipping out a second sword. He kicked a skull at the chimera and ran in after, blades leading the way.</p> 
               <p>Aberny hurried to see if he could dislodge the rock fall and give them a chance to flee. He threw aside several smaller rocks, but realized the boulders would require massive effort to budge.</p> 
               <div class="blurb360"> <a href="/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500_Tali_500.jpeg"> <img src="/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500_Tali_360.jpeg" border="0"> </a>
                <br>Tali's view of the hunt is nothing if not unique.
               </div> 
               <p>The chimera bounded all about the cavern, with plenty of room to maneuver despite its bulk. It flapped up to the far wall, clung there for a moment as its claws dug in, and then dropped to crush the fighter. Ralynn somersaulted aside, and the chimera landed with a boom that shook the whole place.</p> 
               <p>Aberny grabbed up a larger rock and lugged it to the edge. He took aim, and then flung it down at the chimera. He howled and raised a triumphant fist as the rock smashed into one of the beast's wings, preventing another leap-and-crush attempt.</p> 
               <p>Ralynn darted in, using the distraction to gouge the creature's flanks. Aberny went for another rock, as yowls rose from below. Right as he reached the edge a second time, the chimera lunged up, abandoning Ralynn to attack him instead. He threw the rock, but the dragon's head snapped it out of midair. At least now it couldn't spew acid in his face.</p> 
               <p>The other two heads drove forward. He fell back, grabbing for his weapons as fangs and horns strained inches from his feet. Then the chimera bellowed and fell back. Aberny leaned over to see what had happened.</p> 
               <p>Ralynn had hacked off a hind paw, and the chimera now hobbled after him while trailing a ragged, gore-soaked stump. The fighter grinned and flicked blood from his blades. </p> 
               <p>The chimera stumbled forward and Ralynn thrust for the kill. However, the dragon head rose and spewed a wide stream of acid. As Ralynn twisted desperately to dodge this, the chimera threw itself forward. A claw snagged Ralynn's leg and pinned him to the ground. The chimera leaned in, all mouths gaping.</p> 
               <p>Tali's voice rang out. "Ralynn, shut your eyes!"</p> 
               <p>The half-elf squeezed his eyes closed right before a flash of dazzling lights burst before the chimera's faces. It reared and staggered on its remaining hind paw.</p> 
               <p>Freed, Ralynn rolled up and raised both swords as the chimera dropped back in front of him. He brought the blades down on the neck of the nearest head—the goat. The head gave a gargling bleat as it was hacked off to splatter at Ralynn's feet. </p> 
               <p>A frenzied wing beat knocked the fighter back, while the lion and dragon roared and screeched in pain. The chimera hunched and launched itself toward one of the wider cracks in the cavern walls.</p> 
               <p>The crack must've been formed in soft earth, for it burst wide under the chimera's impact, raining roots and rock all about. The creature shoved most of the way out. Its hind leg gave a last kick to free itself, and then only its fading cries could be heard as it fled. </p> 
               <p>Tali emerged from her hiding spot behind an oversized ribcage, while Ralynn caught his breath and Aberny made his way to the chamber floor. By the time he got there, the half-elf and gnome were inspecting the paw and goat head. </p> 
               <p>Ralynn probed the head with the tip of a blade. "Poor trophy. Might as well have killed an oversized goat."</p> 
               <p>Aberny eyed the hole in the cavern wall. "Even if it survives that wound, I doubt it'll return to let you claim the rest." </p> 
               <p>"Just in case," Tali said, "maybe we should get out of here?"</p> 
               <p>The three climbed back to the ledge and began the arduous job of clearing the path out. Before they left, Aberny made sure to retrieve his sword, feeling an odd desire to never travel without one close at hand again. Ralynn grabbed up the paw and head, while Tali chose a few blood-speckled rib fragments.</p> 
               <p>Once they emerged into sunlight and fresh air, Aberny leaned on his staff, suddenly more weary than he'd ever been. "I've a proposition."</p> 
               <p>The two looked to him.</p> 
               <p>"Since our contract was hastily made and without the clearest of wits, what say we mutually dissolve it and let survival be its own reward? We can tell whatever version of what happened here that we wish."</p> 
               <p>Ralynn lifted the chimera parts. "So long as I keep these." He caught Aberny's eye. "I'm not as stuck on our original deal."</p> 
               <p>Tali glanced between the two, curious, but shrugged when neither was forthcoming. "Good enough for me."</p> 
               <p>Aberny smiled, pulled out the battered parchment, and tossed it back down to languish with the bones.</p> 
               <p align="center">∗ ∗ ∗</p> 
               <p>Aberny entered the art gallery, double-checking the card delivered the previous day to make sure he had the right time and place.</p>

We feature the finest paintings and sculptures ever to grace our town, being a testament to Whistledown's continued contributions to the pinnacle of society that is artistic inspiration and craft.</i></p> 
                <p><i>Sincerely,</i><br> <i>Steward Feles, on behalf of the Gilvreau Gallery</i></p> 
               </blockquote> 
               <p>He scanned the main room. Humans, gnomes, elves, and others crowded the hall, where at least a dozen paintings hung alongside another dozen sculptures and carvings. Some of the pieces even combined sculpture and painting, with molded bronze, steel, and silver interwoven with canvas to give the work a surprising depth and substance.</p> 
               <p>In one painting, a shadowy beast loomed over a trio of figures, framed against a background of vivid firelight. There, fighters engaged a chimera on the edges of a rocky pool. And there, random bones had been wired together to create a miniature model of a chimera skeleton, wings spread, looking ready to leap on viewers.</p> 
               <p>Never had Aberny seen such raw depictions of dread and violence. Not only had the artist captured the chimera's bestial qualities, but also the underlying terror and imminence of death it evoked. Many of the scenes even gave the impression of the hunters being the prey.</p> 
               <p>After perusing the selection for a while, he found Tali chatting in a ring of admirers. A month had passed since the ill-fated hunt, and her attire had taken a turn for the fashionable. Adorned with a gem-studded tiara, she wore a dress of blue and crimson. When she spotted him, she excused herself and rushed over to grasp his hand.</p> 
               <p>"Master Aberny! So glad you could make it."</p> 
               <p>He smiled and they exchanged pleasantries, such as her rise in society and how his sword-fighting lessons progressed. When they found a corner beyond the press of the crowd, he cleared his throat.</p> 
               <p>"I've been thinking a bit since we last saw one another. Reflecting on a few oddities of our time in the grasslands."</p> 
               <p>One of her emerald eyebrows twitched. "Such as?"</p> 
               <p>"Such as how the chimera tracked our scent so quickly. Why it took off with you when it had the upper hand with Ralynn. And how you knew enough of its nature—even its language—to appeal to its bestial vanity."</p> 
               <p>Her lips tweaked at the corners. "Quite strange."</p> 
               <p>"As I recall, a large portion of our first dinner went... well, not missing, but perhaps unaccounted for would be the better description. Now, I'm not one to doubt a voracious appetite, but for a gnome, such a repast would've likely split his or her stomach wide—if it was actually devoured at all. And then there was a particular item that would've drawn the creature's ear from a goodly distance."</p> 
               <p>He drew out the Whistledown charm she'd dropped when the chimera had taken her beside the pool. "A memento of our little hunt and congratulations for your success."</p> 
               <p>Tali licked her lips as she squirreled the charm away. Then she glanced about, no doubt looking for a particular half-elf.</p> 
               <p>"Are you going to tell him?" she asked.</p> 
               <p>He chuckled darkly, suspicions confirmed. "I haven't decided. He's not in town at the moment, either way. While the head and paw weren't exactly the trophies Ralynn wished, they worked well enough to boost his reputation—especially after an alchemist confirmed the chimera blood. He left two weeks ago with a band of treasure hunters." </p> 
               <p>Then he shed all mirth. "But I want to know how you managed to come to an agreement with the chimera."</p> 
               <p>Her nose crinkled. "Agreement?"</p> 
               <p>"How did you get the creature to act as a model for your art? An offer of safety in exchange for leading it to us?"</p> 
               <p>Her eyes widened. "No! I might've aggravated the situation a bit, but we had no dealings. It wouldn't have been real, if so. I had to live it. The struggle had to be authentic, or else it wouldn't mean anything."</p> 
               <p>"You understood it. Spoke with it."</p> 
               <p>"Languages are art, like I said. Each one I can converse in adds to my palette of comprehension."</p> 
               <p>"But why? What possessed you to tempt our deaths that way?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh! This, of course." She wobbled her head, indicating the gallery. "My art can now be infused with unparalleled passion and perspective."</p> 
               <p>"You got my men killed."</p> 
               <p>"We all accepted a certain amount of risk, didn't we? I faced the same dangers as everyone else."</p> 
               <p>"You could've told us. We could've set an ambush from the start."</p> 
               <p>"That would've been just as bad as if I'd collaborated with the beast. It would've undermined the reality I needed to experience."</p> 
               <p>He sighed, trying and failing to summon fury at the deception. Sadly, he understood all too well the lengths one might go to for personal advancement. Should he reveal the deal he'd struck with Ralynn? Or perhaps scrawl another debt in his ledgers?</p> 
               <p>Aberny rubbed his chin, as if pondering the virtues of the piece they stood before. "Perhaps Ralynn will never find out, so long as certain steps are taken. A favor paid, say, to avoid dark rumors besmirching the reputation of a promising young artist."</p> 
               <p>Tali squared up with him, thin arms crossed. "So! What's the bargain, then?"</p> 
               <p>He waved at the surrounding artwork. "Your work should be admired by lovers of art far and wide. I would... politely... request an exclusive contract as distributor and representative of your craft beyond Whistledown. Sole purveyor, receiving a significant percentage of every sale for my efforts."</p> 
               <p>Tali grinned. "Ah! I'll have to talk to the gallery owners, but I'll be as persuasive as possible for an old friend." She stuck out a hand. As his engulfed hers for a brief squeeze, she held it a moment longer. "Good fortune, Master Aberny. Of course, I say that hoping you'll funnel some of that my way in the end."</p> 
               <p>His laugh drew a few askance looks. "Be careful what you hope for, dearest Tali. In the end, fortune makes fools of us all."</p>

                </div> 
                <p>I'm from South Australia and started playing RPGs in 1979 with a photocopy of a photocopy of some of the Original D&amp;D books and an incomplete set of polyhedral dice. We gradually added the AD&amp;D books as they came out (it still amuses me to think how impatient I get when my subscriptions are a week late given that I had to wait a whole year between releases back then). Our group had our own little edition war on 2nd Edition's release by the company we referred to as T$R (clever, huh?) Our indignant rage led us to leave D&amp;D and move on to other games over the next fifteen years or so—predominantly Rolemaster, but also a smattering of others.</p> 
                <p>I first became aware of Paizo early in 2008 when time pressures started to make DMing difficult. I looked around for a 'campaign in a box' and discovered the Shackled City compilation which I planned to convert to rolemaster. I enjoyed reading it so much that I went looking on this new-fangled internet thing to discover that Paizo had just completed another Adventure Path (Runelords) and were starting a third. (I think AP#8 had just released). Due to a longstanding paranoia about online purchases, my AP subscription (or 'gateway drug' as I think of it) didn't begin until midway through Second Darkness. Soon afterwards, I was signed up for everything I could get my hands on. I also started furiously backordering all those things I'd missed before they went out of print.</p> 
                <p>Our group now plays an eclectic mix of systems, but all my games are set in Golarion and most of the adventures I run are Paizo APs or modules. I love the way Pathfinder has broadened over the last few years, both in the different product lines but also in the more recent rules supplements - many of which I use even when running other systems. Although I've spent most of my time in the DM's chair, I do play from time to time. My favourite characters tend to be fighters or thieves and I've recently realised I have a disconcerting tendency towards playing conmen, charlatans and duplicitous frauds.</p> 
                <p>The Paizo community is a significant factor that keeps me coming back to Pathfinder. The presence the staff has on the forums and the level of engagement of the company is well known, but the general civility and willingness to help out with advice or clarifications from the other fans is something I think really makes Paizo.com a special corner of the internet. I can't think of anywhere else I'd rather ask a dumb question. It seems that, no matter how blindingly obvious, there's always someone around to explain it even more simply.</p> 
                <p>I have more than enough Pathfinder material to last the rest of my life, but still look forward to every subscription shipment just as much as I did waiting for those AD&amp;D hardcovers to make the slow journey over from America all those years ago.</p>

               <p><span itemprop="description">Winter continues its cruel embrace across the United States this week (well, just about everywhere but here in balmy Seattle, that is), and our <a href="/products/btpy92s9">Reign of Winter</a> miniature reveals for May's <a href="/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids">Pathfinder Battles</a> set just keep on coming!</span></p> 
               <p>This week I'd like to focus on four figures that are, for lack of a better word, monsters. We've shown off a few animals (and there are a few more to come) and a lot of specific enemies so far, so now it's time to pull back the curtain on some of the rank-and-file creatures you're likely to find in your <a href="/products/btpy92s9">Reign of Winter</a>.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459-Maftet_500.jpeg"> <img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459-Maftet_180.jpeg" border="0"> </a>
               </div> 
               <p>Here we have a Maftet, a member of a race of winged feline humanoids inspired by an Egyptian goddess (and included on page 188 of <a href="/products/btpy8odu"><i>Bestiary 3</i></a>. Maftets dwell in crumbling ruins and lost cities, and come up several times in the <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/reignOfWinter">Reign of Winter Adventure Path</a>. This particular example wields two swords and stands about 7 feet tall, making her an imposing encounter indeed. The Maftet is a Medium figure slated at the common rarity.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459-Faun_500.jpeg"> <img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459-Faun_180.jpeg" border="0"> </a>
               </div> 
               <p>Folks have been asking for more fey miniatures for a long time, and I'm happy to get the opportunity presented by the monster mix of the <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/reignOfWinter">Reign of Winter Adventure Path</a> to start delivering. Here we have one of my personal favorites from back in the Narnia days, a Faun! Our Faun (also in <a href="/products/btpy8odu"><i>Bestiary 3</i></a>) is shown playing a pipe and cavorting around. He's pretty cool. This Medium figure is slated at the uncommon rarity.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK7159-MirrorMan_500.jpeg"> <img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK7159-MirrorMan_180.jpeg" border="0"> </a>
               </div> 
               <p>In a recent comment thread I mentioned that the set would include a Mirror Man, a creepy construct introduced in the pages of <a href="/products/btpy8wfl">Pathfinder Adventure Path #68</a>, the second <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/reignOfWinter">Reign of Winter</a> adventure. Even though your own face may reflect back on you when you encounter a Mirror Man, rest assured that there is a human spirit giving the thing animate force. Yes, it may be the trapped spirit of a condemned criminal, but don't let that get in the way of your primping. The Mirror Man is a Medium, uncommon figure.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459-Catoblepas_500.jpeg"> <img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459-Catoblepas_180.jpeg" border="0"> </a>
               </div> 
               <p>One of my favorite aspects of building <a href="/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids">Pathfinder Battles</a> set lists is including creatures that have never before been produced in prepainted plastic. To my knowledge, this big guy fits the bill. Here we have the lowly and unloved Catoblepas, a creature first described by the historian Pliny the Elder around AD 77, so I think he qualifies as a "classic" monster. Unlike the real version, this miniature's gaze will not turn you to stone (I can't promise the same for your player characters). The Catoblepas is a cool, hefty figure that makes use of his Large size. He is slated at the rare rarity, and his stats can be found on page 52 of <a href="/products/btpy8hif"><i>Bestiary 2</i></a>.</p> 
               <p>And that's it for this week! I'm off to the New York Toy Fair tomorrow morning, where I will be meeting with my counterpart at WizKids to hatch diabolical plans for the coming years (among other things). We'll be back next week with more <a href="/products/btpy92s9">Reign of Winter</a> miniature reveals. In the meantime, try to keep warm!</p>

                <br>Good ol' rock. Nothing beats rock!
               </div> 
               <p>The defenses of Sandpoint are clearly no match for these giants, but we're sure you're up for the challenge. While it might seem like the best way to beat a creature of great size is with overwhelming numbers—and certainly neither an inspirational song from Lem nor a helpful sword blow from Valeros would be refused!—canny giant-hunters like Harsk can tell you all about the dangers of grouping up against giants. Much better to find a good vantage point for a well-placed shot. The eyes, throat, and knees are all excellent targets... if you can hit them.</p> 
               <p>But let's back up a second (if we can afford a second) and find out what's going on here.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6004_Sandpoint1_500.jpeg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6004_Sandpoint1_180.jpeg" border="0"></a> <a href="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6004_Sandpoint2_500.jpeg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6004_Sandpoint2_180.jpeg" border="0"></a> 
                <br>Doesn't anyone STAY saved?
               </div> 
               <p>While you were up in the Hook Mountains ending Barl Breakbones' threat to the area (along with his life), the giants apparently had plans of their own. The stone giant warlord Teraktinus is leading a host of giants against the city, bombarding it with flung boulders and literally tearing apart Sandpoint's walls, buildings, and citizens. As you arrive, the siege is already underway, and the pressure is on. The giants' apparent aim is to reduce the city to rubble, and you'll need to hurry if you want to stop them and save Sandpoint. </p> 
               <p>Down here, tracking and sniping giants is all well and good, but some people prefer to do their giant-slaying up close and personal. For those people, we present the giantbane dagger. </p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6004_Giantbane_500.jpeg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6004_Giantbane_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
                <br>Merisiel-recommended. Harsk-approved.
               </div> 
               <p>Though it's perfectly capable of stabbing goblins, humans, elves, ranger-wights, and dragons, this little beauty prefers to dine on a steady stream of ogres, trolls, ogrekin, and giants of all flavors. Err, kinds. As Ameiko's brother Tsuto once said, "The death of a thousand cuts need not require a thousand blades." Or, as Merisiel often says, "Mine!"</p> 
               <p>Killing, stabbing, shooting, and bashing are all fine, but sometimes things don't go your way. When that happens, you want Kyra, Lem, Seelah, Lini, or maybe even Harsk to have one of these, and they want it too. </p>
               <div class="blurbCenter">

                <br>And it didn't even take my whole turn!
               </div> 
               <p>Oh, one more thing: Did I mention that the stone giants brought a dragon?</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6004_Longtooth_500.jpeg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6004_Longtooth_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
                <br>Giants smash, dragons burn.
               </div> 
               <p>Yeah. They brought a dragon. It's sure to get toasty around here (unless you're Sajan. Sajan cheats.), but with a bit of luck, or perhaps some magic, you might be able to fight dragon-fire with dragon-fire.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6004_CharmedDragon_500.jpeg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6004_CharmedDragon_180.jpeg" border="0"></a>
                <br>What could possibly go wrong?
               </div> 
               <p>Now, sometimes you're happy to gain a boon if you roll well, and content to make progress if you don't. Other times, you really want to succeed. This ally is worth the investment (and not only because he doesn't like it when you fail!)</p> 
               <p>That's just a sampling from the start of Fortress of the Stone Giants, where you finally get to try out those shiny role cards you've been looking at for months. You'll go on the offensive, taking the fight to the giants of Jorgenfist and learning a little something about the forces behind all the troubles of the previous adventures. But please, remember one thing: when you hear flapping wings and screeching in the tower, that wasn't my fault.</p> 
               <p>Well, maybe a little. </p> 
               <p>Thanks for playing!</p>

               <p>How did he still hear Whistledown's fluting charms in the distance? Even if they remained closed enough, normally they only played at night, when the lake breezes blew through the village. Had the chimera's attack jarred him more than he thought?</p>

Where did it lurk? Chimeras often holed up in their dens between meals. Yet this stretch of land lacked any significant caves he knew of, having hastily studied a few maps before they set out.</p>

                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500_Chimera.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500_Chimera_360.jpeg" border="0"></a>
                <br>Vicious hunger gleams in each set of the chimera's putrid-yellow eyes.
               </div> 
               <p>Not more than half an hour later, Ralynn crouched and touched a patch of earth. Aberny and Tali hesitated, checking all about until the fighter waved them closer.</p> 
               <p>"Sign?" Aberny asked.</p> 
               <p>Ralynn shook his head and displayed fingers stained with mud. "Water nearby."</p> 
               <p>Aberny nodded, but Tali pouted in confusion.</p> 
               <p>"Water," the merchant explained, "suggests a spot where animals might come to drink on a regular basis. Tempting for predators."</p> 
               <p>They crept forward, weapons in Aberny's and Ralynn's hands, a charcoal nub and parchment in Tali's. They crested a subtle ridge and found it sloped down sharply into a rockier area, where a stream funneled in and formed a wide pool ringed by crumbling earth and stones. The place appeared undisturbed, but Aberny well knew appearances deceived only the foolish.</p> 
               <p>Tali wriggled in delight. "Gorgeous. I must fix this place in my mind." </p> 
               <p>As she dangled bare feet over the ridge and outlined the geography, Ralynn shifted closer to Aberny, voice lowered.</p> 
               <p>"I think the beast is close, but waiting to catch us off guard again. How about we use her as bait?"</p> 
               <p>Aberny narrowed his eyes. "You're that desperate for the bounty?"</p> 
               <p>Ralynn raised both hands. "I never make a bet I don't intend to win. But I'm not saying we let her get eaten. We'll divert it before it reaches her."</p> 
               <p>The screams of Aberny's men briefly intruded on his thoughts until he shoved them back. He shook his head. "No. I'll go down with her while you watch our backs."</p> 
               <p>Ralynn shrugged. "Won't stop you."</p> 
               <p>Calling Tali to help him refill their waterskins, Aberny led her into the depression, trying not to skid too much on scree and raise a clatter. When they reached the pool, he set his staff down and kneeled to cup a palm of water. As he swallowed, he glanced at Tali's sketch, noting she'd expertly captured the rocky pool, but had added a few embellishments, including scattered animal skeletons and the chimera itself crouched among the bodies.</p> 
               <p>"Preparing a morbid masterpiece?" he asked.</p> 
               <p>She held the parchment out, eyeing it critically. "Hm. Are the bones taking it too far?" </p> 
               <p>He peered at the chimeric figure as she filled in various details. "Are you managing that from memory last night? Impressive."</p> 
               <p>She pointed with her charcoal nub. "Oh, no. It's right over there."</p> 
               <p>Aberny raised his eyes and met the triple gaze of the chimera as it stood from its hiding spot across the pool. Its tawny, dappled hide had blended in with the yellow earth and stones, and its goat and dragon heads emerged from where they'd been tucked under the wings until then. </p> 
               <p>Ralynn must've known it was there the whole time. It couldn't have eluded his half-elven sight that easily. </p> 
               <p>The chimera's dragon maw drizzled acid, while its goat teeth gnawed a scrap of flesh that Aberny hoped didn't come from any of last night's kills. It began prowling around the pool toward them. Its ears twitched, and it spoke through its lion head alone this time. </p> 
               <p>"What's it saying?" Aberny asked Tali.</p> 
               <p>Her tongue darted over her lips. "Oh... er... something about me not being more than a nibble, while you might make a few mouthfuls."</p> 
               <p>Aberny rose, taking up his staff and drawing his sword. He used the staff to pull Tali along with him as he backed away toward Ralynn's concealed spot on the near ridge. But before they took two steps, the chimera filled the area with a three-throated roar and a great beat of wings propelled it straight at them.</p> 
               <p>The first leap sent it splashing into the middle of the pool. The second brought it onto the bank before them, where it shook itself like a wet dog, whipping out a vortex of water. In the midst of that half-blinding spray, it rushed in. </p> 
               <p>Ralynn's yell resounded as he landed on the chimera's back, swords driving down to plunge into its lungs and heart. Its water-slicked fur, though, offered no firm footing. He slipped and what might've been a death blow merely scored across the beast's ribs. The chimera screeched and reared. Ralynn dropped one sword to grab a fistful of fur, holding on as he readied for another strike. </p> 
               <p>Aberny forced himself forward, spearing the staff at the lion snout while chopping the sword whenever the dragon head wove too close. </p> 
               <p>The chimera fell back to all fours, and its wings slammed back over Ralynn, briefly clamping the fighter against its back. Then the chimera threw itself into a roll. Ralynn cried out as the creature's bulk crushed him into the earth, and he dropped off to lie stunned in the muddy gravel. </p> 
               <p>The chimera flipped back to its feet. Fangs slavered drool and acid as it approached the stunned fighter.</p> 
               <p>Then a harsh keening filled the hollow, painful enough that Aberny almost dropped his weapons to clamp hands over his ears. The chimera's heads swung around to fix on him. The creature growled deep enough to make the waters ripple, and snarled in its own tongue. </p> 
               <p>Aberny braced as it loped for him. He lashed out when it neared, but a claw struck him across the stomach, throwing him aside. He lost staff and sword as he rolled and slammed up against the base of the embankment. </p> 
               <p>The keening cut off, followed by a shriek from Tali. Aberny's jarred vision cleared just as the chimera flung itself into the sky, Tali screaming and writhing in its lion's maw. He stared aghast as the chimera made off with their small companion, following the stream as it wound out of sight among the hills. Her cries dwindled into nothing.</p> 
               <p>The merchant pushed upright, groaning at a clench of pain where the chimera had struck him. His chest would be a mass of bruises, and breathing already proved strained. A quick inspection revealed four tears and shallow cuts across his torso. Seemed he owed Desna, the goddess of luck, a few prayers. </p> 
               <p>He struggled to his feet and limped to Ralynn, who lurched up, gasping and reaching for his weapons. The half-elf stilled as he realized they stood alone.</p> 
               <p>"What happened? It fled?"</p> 
               <p>Aberny gestured to Tali's parchment, abandoned when the chimera nabbed her. It had fluttered from her grasp and landed in the pool, already a pulpy mess. "Maybe it wants to work up an appetite before it feasts."</p> 
               <p>Ralynn grimaced and rose to retrieve his short swords. Then he grunted and bent over, hand pressed to his side.</p> 
               <p>"Damn it to Hell. Must've broken a rib." </p> 
               <p>Aberny rummaged through the satchel of food and supplies he'd brought. While several had been smashed in his tumble, one healing potion had blessedly survived. He considered his own minor wounds and chances for survival. Then he handed the vial to Ralynn, who nodded gratefully and downed it. </p> 
               <p>As the fighter recovered, Aberny went to where Tali had been standing and closed his eyes to whisper a prayer of protection. <i>Desna smile on the gnome, and may she be lucky enough to live, despite all odds</i>.</p> 
               <p>When he opened his eyes, his gaze fell on an item where Tali had been standing. He bent over to investigate and found... a Whistledown charm. The wooden carving formed a complicated spiral, the tip secured with a metal hook where it was meant to dangle from eaves or doorways. She must've had it altered to produce the music on command, rather than just at night. Had she brought it thinking to actually mesmerize the beast or use it as a distracting weapon, as she'd just done?</p> 
               <p>He tucked this into a pocket, inert for the time. Then he turned to Ralynn, who stretched and twisted to test his healed ribs. "We have to go after her."</p> 
               <p>Ralynn frowned. "Actually, I've been rethinking my rule about never backing off from a bet."</p> 
               <p>Aberny strode over and grabbed the half-elf's collar. Ralynn stiffened, but didn't draw a blade.</p> 
               <p>"You sent us straight into its grasp just now, and her potential death is on your soul. You want to leave this hunt a coward?"</p> 
               <p>Ralynn jerked out of his grip and brushed himself off. "Better a coward than dead! And since when have you cared about someone's fate unless they put coin in your pocket? Oh, don't look surprised. You act so friendly, buying us rounds all night long—but only because we're spilling gossip you can use to get better deals. I know how it works."</p> 
               <p>"That was... that was idle business. This is life or death!" </p> 
               <p>"Thought it was all the same to you."</p> 
               <p>Aberny threw up his hands and spun away, sick of them both.</p> 
               <p>Ralynn's voice softened. "Look, there's no shame in knowing when to cut your losses. The biggest payoff doesn't mean a thing if you aren't alive to collect it. Even if we find wherever it's hauled her off to, we'll be walking straight into its territory. And it has a hostage."</p> 
               <p>Aberny stared into the water as if it might offer a solution. Then he focused on his reflection and realized he still had certain resources available. Best use them. </p> 
               <p>He turned back to the fighter. "I'll make you an offer." </p> 
               <p>Ralynn eyed him in suspicion. "Like?" </p> 
               <p>"Help me rescue her, and the bounty, plus a thousand from me, is yours. You don't even have to kill the chimera. Just as long as she lives."</p> 
               <p>The half-elf blinked. "You're serious."</p> 
               <p>"Entirely."</p> 
               <p>Ralynn scowled, looking like a trapped beast himself, sleek figure coiled as if ready to sprint for freedom. Then he sighed and straightened. "Fine. You've got a deal."</p> 
               <p>Relieved, if slightly, Aberny pointed out the direction the beast had flown. He and Ralynn followed the river, finding it broadened farther up and cut through a ravine that would've been invisible from their trek up in the fields.</p> 
               <p>At last, Ralynn crouched and pulled Aberny down with him. He pointed ahead. The stream poured out from a wide crevice, not a hundred paces ahead. Half-hidden by overgrown grasses, the opening led into the earth beneath a large hill. </p> 
               <p>They split up and approached the crevice from opposing angles. One sword readied, Ralynn eased up and peered inside for a moment. Then he slipped in.</p> 
               <p>Aberny held his breath until the half-elf leaned back out and waved him on.</p> 
               <p>Once beyond the low stony lip, the ceiling quickly rose enough for standing room, and outside light reached past to show a natural tunnel leading into the depths of the hill. They paused, listening.</p> 
               <p>Tali's voice echoed from somewhere deeper in, indistinct. A guttural murmur followed, as if she conversed with the chimera.</p> 
               <p>Aberny's heart rose. Alive! But not for long if they bungled this. </p> 
               <p>Ralynn took the lead, using his heightened sight to guide them. After creeping through a darker section, light once more appeared ahead. After ten paces, the tunnel ended, exiting onto a wide ledge that curved around the edges of an earthy cavern.</p> 
               <p>The chimera's den lay within the hollow hill, the walls all root-snaked dirt and rock. Several wide cracks allowed shafts of sunlight in, illuminating the scene below as the pair sneaked to the edge. </p> 
               <p>Tali stood before the chimera, which lay basking in a narrow splay of sun, forepaws crossed, tail twitching. All three heads watched her, cocked as if fascinated by this odd creature it had brought back.</p> 
               <p>All around them lay spines and skulls and femurs of a dozen different creatures, including at least a few humanoids by Aberny's estimation. Tali had gathered a pile of bones and now worked them together, linked and stacked into a grisly sculpture—a fragile spread of ribs that evoked wings. </p> 
               <p>"See?" she said, as she crafted the piece. "Even in death, there's beauty. Think of it! If you let me live, I could craft you a gorgeous necklace out of nothing but vertebrae and finger bones. I don't suppose you have any gems lying about? Those could be socketed to enhance your natural glory. No? Pity. But one must work with what one has."</p> 
               <p>Ralynn and Aberny drew back while the chatter continued below.</p> 
               <p>"I don't suppose you'd let me paint you? Trap your essence for all to admire?"</p> 
               <p>Ralynn made several circling and grasping gestures with one hand. Aberny shook his head, not understanding. Did he think to try and sneak down the ledge without drawing the beast's attention? Or attempt another leap onto the chimera's back? </p> 
               <p>"Oh! Have I mentioned how I love the way your fur absolutely traps the light? Divine." </p> 
               <p>At Ralynn's impatient pushing motions, Aberny edged along where the ledge sloped toward the cave floor. The half-elf nodded, moving the opposite direction. </p> 
               <p>"I once saw a chimera trapped in a menagerie, you know. Such a horrible thing to do to such a magnificent beast."</p> 
               <p>A snuffling made him freeze. The chimera's gravelly voice rose, the words alien, but the tone unmistakable. It had detected the intruders.</p> 
               <p>Tali sighed. "For Shelyn's sake. It's a fools-be-damned trap. Run!"</p>

               <p>Over the past three seasons, the Pathfinder Society campaign has published special scenarios that are exclusive to 4-star GMs, 5-star GMs, Venture Captains, and Venture Lieutenants—both to reward our top judges and to incentivize others to GM more and earn those stars. When <i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #2–EX: The Midnight Mauler</i> first came out in early 2011, the campaign had one 5-star GM, about half a dozen 4-star GMs, and 18 newly minted Venture Captains. We've since grown to over 50 5-star GMs, more than 150 4-star GMs, and 345 Venture Captains and Venture Lieutenants! Rather impressive!</p> 
               <p>Since then, we've introduced quite a few new GM rewards that continue to reward and incentivize the campaign's excellent volunteers to keep sharing their hobby with others: limited replay and the star bonus on "shirt re-rolls." Today we're announcing both a new reward and a change to how we're handling the exclusive scenario this year.</p> 
               <h2>The Exclusive</h2> 
               <p>This year we're releasing <a href="/products/btpy8wrx"><i>The Ruins of Bonekeep, Part 1: The Silent Grave</i></a> as an exclusive scenario for qualifying GMs, who can now run the adventure anywhere. These GMs should see the scenario in their downloads early this week. Keep in mind that when qualifying for one's fifth star, all Ruins of Bonekeep adventures contribute to a GM's 10 required Exclusive or Special events.</p> 
               <h2>GM Star Chronicle</h2> 
               <p>Back when Mike first became Campaign Coordinator, I remember sending him an elaborate proposal for a GM reward system. Back then it was clunky, required heavy IT support, and accurately reflected how new I was to booncraft, so the idea faded from memory. We recently rediscovered those old plans, blew off the dust, and (with the help of some clever Venture Captains and Venture Lieutenants) revised the concept for distribution. In addition to being available for download from this blog, we will add these to the <a href="/pathfinderSociety/pfsproducts/pfsFreeProducts">Free Products page</a> in the next day or so.</p>

               <p>The GM Star Chronicle sheet is a one-page reward that provides benefits that scale with a player's stars and a character's level. Each represents a character's tutelage and special training with one of the three Masters: Aram Zey, Kreighton Shaine, or Marcos Farabellus. When you meet both criteria for a boon (such as the GM having 3 stars and the character being level 5+), you can skip a Day Job roll or spend 1 Prestige Point to train with your patron and gain that boon's benefits. At this time, each GM can only select and assign one such Chronicle sheet. The exception to this limit is a 5-star GM, who can select and assign an additional Chronicle sheet to a different character for each additional 50 tables of GM credit he or she earns (two sheets at 200 games, three sheets at 250, et cetera).</p>

               <p>I'm excited to hear what new characters these inspire and how existing characters might connect with these eminent instructors.</p>

              <h1 itemprop="headline">Happy 40th, D&amp;D</h1> 
              <p class="date">Friday, February 8, 2014</p> 
              <div itemprop="articleBody"> 
               <p><span itemprop="description">With the 40th anniversary of Dungeons and Dragons hitting in the past week, it has made me wax nostalgic for the tales of my gaming past. Thinking back to the beginning, to my first D&amp;D game, it is amazing to see what an impact it has made on my life.</span></p> 
               <p>I grew up the typical brainiac nerd. Each day, I would come home from school and curl up with a science fiction or fantasy novel. Piers Anthony, Stephen R. Donaldson, Fritz Lieber, Michael Moorcock, Jack Vance, Roger Zelazny, Robert E. Howard, Anne McCaffrey and more told their tales of daring and adventure and I was hooked. Reading was a solitary hobby that fit well with my shy persona.</p> 
               <p>That all changed when I stumbled upon a very simple video game called Akalabeth. It was written by Richard Garriott (better known to most as Lord British) and involved a very simple interface where you would travel into dungeons, kill things, and take their treasure. I was hooked! I didn’t have my own computer back in 1980, but the folks at Computer World in Appleton, Wisconsin were more than happy to let me come to their store after school and play Akalabeth.</p> 
               <p>In the fall of 1981, I was off to St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota to get my bachelors in biology. Right away, I went into withdrawal from my daily Akalabeth fix. I put up some posters around the cafeteria hoping that somebody might have a computer with Akalabeth on it. I never got a bite on that, but a guy let me know that he was starting a game of Dungeons &amp; Dragons and I was invited to give it a try. Now, I had no idea what Dungeons &amp; Dragons was, but I figured it probably had something to do with a computer, so I was interested in giving it a try. Imagine my surprise when I showed up at the designated dorm room and there were six other people there!</p> 
               <p>I had a bit of apprehension—what did I get myself into? But I fought down my fears and sat down as the guy who invited me explained that we were going to be playing this game called Dungeons &amp; Dragons. As he talked, I became more and more fascinated. We were going to be telling a story together as a group. There were all these weird shaped dice and painted metal miniatures. I couldn’t tell you any details about the adventure that night. The GM never ran a second session. But I was hooked and told my mother about this new game I had discovered. That Christmas, I was given my very own D&amp;D intro box which I devoured like a sailor dying of thirst. I also received two boxes of Grenadier miniatures, one of characters and one of monsters, which I painted over my Christmas break.</p> 
               <p>By the time I got back to St. Olaf, I was ready to GM a game. I was desperate to do so. Me, the shy bookworm nerd, was eager to reach out to people I hardly knew and take on the role of the director of a game, the narrator of a story. I was ready to become a leader!</p> 
               <p>My first regular gaming group was a couple of friends. We played Keep on the Borderlands, because that was the adventure that came with the Beginner’s box set that my mother had bought me for Christmas. Now, Keep was meant to train new DMs by encouraging them to add their own encounters and expand the adventure. I took the map of the area surrounding the keep and the Caves of Chaos, and made a more detailed map that included my own first dungeon, a ruined castle on a nearby river. Attached is my first ever dungeon map. I tried to make things as realistic as I could, but there are so many problems with my map, that it makes me laugh now to look at it. But I was just an eager new DM with a couple of eager players, and we had a blast in that first dungeon!</p>

               </div> 
               <p>There were just a few players in my first campaign, so I did double duty. I DMed the campaign, but I also played a character in the campaign, the Fighter/MU Erwyle. Attached is his character sheet from the end of his career. A couple of notes: the character sheet is one that I made up on the school’s UNIX computers, and Erwyle’s possessions and magic-items aren’t on the sheet because they took up a print off that was seven pages long! Erwyle never made it beyond the first campaign except as an NPC, but I’ll never forget those first adventures. I even got superstar artist Clyde Caldwell to draw a picture of Erwyle for me at my first GenCon!</p>

               </div> 
               <p>It wasn’t belong before the group had grown to six and we set out to tell tales of adventure across the world of Greyhawk. We met every Friday and Saturday night, playing well into the night, and sometimes into the next morning! The Slaver Series, Against the Giants, Descent into the Depths, the Temple of Elemental Evil, Against the Cult of the Reptile God, the Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth, the Sinister Secret of Saltmarch, the Secret of Bone Hill, and many, many others tested the wits of my players over the course of the next six years. Players came and went as some graduated and new players joined, but the core of my players stayed the same. It was a heady time for me as the campaign became the thing of legends among gamers at St. Olaf and I had a long waiting list to get into the campaign. Life-long friendships were formed and memories were made that shall never be forgotten.</p> 
               <p>It all came to an end when I was asked to join my first gaming company, Lion Rampant games in 1987. But it was those early years exploring the World of Greyhawk and learning to be a great DM that really helped me the most as I began a career that would go from Lion Rampant, to White Wolf, to Wizards of the Coast, and now to Paizo.</p> 
               <p>A couple of years back, something happened that was a first for me. I lost one of my original players, Dar Lund. It hit me hard at the time and I didn’t want to have to deal with the loss of somebody who shared those heady early days with me. Dar was one of the chefs at St. Olaf College and it was through one of my players, Rob, that Dar was introduced to me. I’ll never forget his first character, Roy P. Zabblapper III, the first born son of a vagabond scribe (yeah, I was using the character background charts from Dragon Magazine). Zabber (as he was affectionately known) was also knicknamed the Dwarven Blender, because of his two-handed, Hasted fighting style that left more than one monster beaten to a pulp. If the plot dragged too much during the game, Dar would look at me and blurt out, "Zabber heads through the door." He got himself into more than one pickle that the rest of the party had to bail him out of by doing this, but it only added to the legend. Dar played in my campaign until I left Minnesota in 1988. He was a player I could count on to be there rain or shine, with his trusty dice at hand, along with his dragon-shaped ashtray. When I spent two years deciding where my life was going to go, Dar and his new wife, Betsy, allowed me to sleep on their couch, running D&amp;D games whenever I could get four players together.</p> 
               <p>To my friend Dar I raise a glass of Velunan Fireamber Wine—to days of adventure and friendship that will never be forgotten! </p>

               <p><span itemprop="description">It's been a crazy busy week here at Paizo, so in deference to my overloaded schedule I hope you'll forgive a relatively brief set of previews this week. These figures are from May's <a href="/products/btpy92s9">Reign of Winter</a> set of <a href="/pathfinder/pathfinderMiniatures/wizKids">Pathfinder Battles</a> prepainted fantasy miniatures.</span></p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_Owl_500.jpeg"> <img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_Owl_180.jpeg" border="0"> </a>
               </div> 
               <p>Folks have been asking for more animals for quite some time, and I'm happy to say that the <a href="/products/btpy92s9">Reign of Winter</a> set delivers. This Owl is a Small, common figure. </p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_NazenhaVasilliovna_500.jpeg"> <img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_NazenhaVasilliovna_180.jpeg" border="0"> </a>
               </div> 
               <p>Owls are common familiars of winter witches, and here we have the winter witch Nazenha Vasilliovna, straight from the cover of <a href="/products/btpy8wfl">Pathfinder Adventure Path #68</a>. Nazenha is a major villain in the campaign, but she also works as any female human spellcaster or even a player character. Her icicle crown, wand, and sickle blade are all cast in clear plastic. Nazenha Vasilliovna is a Medium figure slated at the rare rarity.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_Goat_500.jpeg"> <img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_Goat_180.jpeg" border="0"> </a>
               </div> 
               <p>This is a Goat. It's a Small, common figure.</p> 
               <div class="blurbCenter"> <a href="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_RadosekPavril_500.jpeg"> <img src="/image/content/PathfinderBattles/WZK71459_RadosekPavril_180.jpeg" border="0"> </a>
               </div> 
               <p>And here we have the goat's owner, the witch Radosek Pavril. Pavril is a servant of Nazenha, so all four of this week's characters likely spend a lot of time together. As a villain in the very first adventure in the <a href="/pathfinder/adventurePath/reignOfWinter">Reign of Winter Adventure Path</a>, Pavril is sure to hector and annoy your player characters. He will probably not get their goat, however, as he already has one. Radosek Pavril also has an icicle wand cast in clear plastic. He's a Medium, uncommon figure with quite a lot of versatility. </p> 
               <p>And that's it for this very, very busy and hectic week. On a side note, you may have noticed that our partners at WizKids announced a partnership with another fantasy RPG company today, and that they plan to release miniatures for that line as well. We have known about this for a while here at Paizo, and have no reason to assume that this new development will have any impact on the Pathfinder Battles line, which continues to march forward.</p> 
               <p>Onward and upward, and have a great weekend, everybody!</p>

Here are five reasons why:</span></p> 
               <ul> 
                <li><b>Half-Elves and Half-Orcs</b>: Readers have been asking for a book on these unusual races for years, and <i>Bastards of Golarion</i> makes such wishes a reality. Numerous details and expanded flavor provide inspiration for these mixed-blooded adventurers and inform players how their half-elf or half-orc character may interact with others in the world of Golarion. Oh, and did I mention a flurry of new traits and rules options for each of these races?</li> 
                <li><b>Regional Variants</b>: The half-human child of a Snowcaster elf is sure to be different than that of an elf from Kyonin, and the same can be said for desert orcs from Osirion versus orcs from the Hold of Belkzen. All-new details on ten (five for half-elves, five for half-orcs) of these half-blooded variants breathe life into your game and allow for a bevy of new character choices. New alternative racial traits make sure the rules represent your unique character, whether she be descended from the jungle orcs of southern Garund or the mysterious elves of the Mordant Spire.</li> 
                <li><b>Character Themes</b>: Half-elves and half-orcs aren't the only people of Golarion to come from unusual or dubious origins. Even seemingly unassuming humans can be bastards given the right backstory! Four diverse character themes in this book provide inspiration for an infinite number of characters and stories. Whether your character calls himself a bastard or a celebrity, an outcast or an unfortunate, these character themes and related rules options shine a light on previously unenviable origin stories and show how such characters can rise from regret to resplendence!</li> 
                <li><b>Half-Race Hometowns</b>: You've decided your bastardly adventurer's race and background story, but where did this character even come from? Information on Averaka—the city of half-orcs—and Erages—haven for half-elves—make sure your bastard's hometown is as fleshed out as she is. Regional traits and archetypes for characters from either of these unique locales tie your character's formidable past to her heroic present.</li> 
                <li><b>Build-A-Bastard</b>: In addition to details and traits for bastards of unusual origins (such as the strange gillmen of Absalom or the half-hag changelings from northern Avistan), the last few pages of this book provide suggestions and rules for creating characters whose racial ancestry is perhaps less obvious or more distant. Ever wanted to play a human character that's actually 1/8th orc and 1/8th dhampir? This book shows you how.</li>

              <h2>Chapter 2: Foes by Firelight</h2> 
              <div itemprop="articleBody"> 
               <p><span itemprop="description">Aberny gaped at the body for a moment, blood staining the earth at his feet. Then the scene around the campfire snatched his stare away.</span></p> 
               <p>The chimera crouched on the far side of the fire, a guard pinned and twitching beneath its massive forepaws. One of the servants crawled for the trees. Entrails dragged from a horrible gash along his side.</p> 
               <p>Leathery wings tucked back along the chimera's body as muscles bunched for another attack. Its three heads wove independently—a maned lion's, a horned goat's, and a green dragon's. Each set of eyes gleamed with a putrid yellow-green light, alive with vicious hunger. Triple maws drooled in anticipation of a feast. The lion snarled, while the dragon puffed an emerald haze that sizzled as it plumed over the fire. Acid, Aberny realized.</p> 
               <p>He nearly ducked back inside, but he'd not built his reputation on cowardice. Taking up a knobbed walking staff from beside the tent flap, he emerged and grasped it in both hands. A gasp drew his glance aside to Tali, who'd poked her head out from her tent, and sketched furiously on a parchment.</p> 
               <p>Then the chimera—roaring, screeching, and bleating—lunged at the second guard, who'd tried to circle around to flank it in the brush. A sweep of a paw and wing knocked the man back and the sword flew from his hands.</p> 
               <p>Ralynn dove in from the other side, a wordless battle cry erupting from him.</p> 
               <div class="blurb360">
                <a href="/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500_Ralynn.jpg"><img src="/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500_Ralynn_360.jpeg" border="0"></a>
                <br>Ralynn combines the ferocity and grace of his half-elven heritage.
               </div> 
               <p>Aberny never knew such an immense beast could move so fast. It snapped its lion fangs while trying to gore the fighter with its goat horns. At the same time, the dragon head curled back around to spew another stream of acid onto the hapless guard. The man's screams wrenched Aberny's guts, but there was nothing he could do.</p> 
               <p>Wielding two short swords, the half-elf had to get in close to do any damage, putting himself within range of wings, talons, and fangs. The chimera lashed with its bared claws while snapping at Ralynn from several directions at once. The fighter evaded the bites, but one claw stuck him across a shoulder and sent him tumbling.</p> 
               <p>Ralynn rolled through the blow and back up to his feet, swords readied. The dragon head clamped down on the guard's body and flung it through the air at the fighter.</p> 
               <p>Even as Ralynn dodged, the beast pounced, leaping through the flames of the campfire. The stink of burning fur filled the air as its hind legs trampled the blaze, and the beast's roar shook the shadows themselves. Burning logs scattered about, casting just enough residual light to limn the fight in a red glow.</p> 
               <p>Ralynn hurtled forward, swords raised. As the chimera pounced, he tucked and rolled, trailing a slash at its belly. The chimera yowled and threw up chunks of grassy earth as it dug in and reversed course.</p> 
               <p>Aberny lunged and swung his staff, trying to distract it so Ralynn might get in a solid blow. The unsatisfying thump on the creature's hind side only served to irritate the beast, which sideswiped with a paw, while the goat's head jerked toward the merchant. He threw himself aside, almost crushing Tali, who yelped and rolled out of the way at the last instant.</p> 
               <p>She hurried to his side and tugged at his robe. Aberny lurched to his feet, fearing the chimera might decide to eliminate the two unarmed party members.</p> 
               <p>But Ralynn had reengaged, combining the ferocity and grace of his mixed parentage. Blades flashed in the light of dying embers as he turned the chimera away from the others, expertly rushing in and twisting aside before it could land another blow. However, he couldn't maneuver for any serious strike.</p> 
               <p>The horses had already gone near-mad in their proximity to the chimera, and their efforts to escape only grew more frantic as the creature dove into their midst. In a frenzy of teeth and talons, the beast laid several of the hapless pack animals low, while two others at last tore loose and galloped off.</p> 
               <p>Then the poisonous green gaze of all three heads locked back on the companions, who could only watch in dismay. Three voices spoke in unison, each a bestial utterance that tortured Aberny's ears. He'd traveled widely enough to recognize the language of dragons, but didn't speak any of it.</p> 
               <p>Ralynn winced as well. "What's it growling about?"</p> 
               <p>Tali perked up. "It says to be happy it's already feasted tonight, but it'll be hungry again tomorrow and has our scent. Also, it called you a weakling coward."</p> 
               <p>Aberny raised an eyebrow her way. She knew its language?</p> 
               <p>Ralynn flourished a sword. "Drop in for lunch and I'll have your heads for trophies."</p> 
               <p>The chimera snarled at Ralynn's challenge. Then, with a final chuff, its leonine head snatched up the one of the servants' bodies. The creature spun about and charged into the darkness. Moments later, a flap of enormous wings indicated it had taken flight.</p> 
               <p>The survivors studied the starry sky for several minutes, ensuring the beast didn't intend an immediate return and ambush. Then Ralynn glared at the few dribbles of blood on his blade and headed for the nearest brush where he wiped it clean.</p> 
               <p>"Well, you two were useless," he said over a shoulder. "Try running screaming into the night with the horses next time and at least provide a distraction."</p> 
               <p>"Useless?" Tali shot back. "I interpreted its warning, didn't I? That's doing plenty. Want me to fight for you? Then offer me your share of the reward. Didn't you say there was no sign of the creature around when we camped. Piss-poor tracking! Certainly let our guard down. How'd it know we were here?"</p> 
               <p>"Beyond our fire and earlier noisy arguing?" Aberny shook his head. "It must've caught detected us while prowling about." He frowned at the corpses. "It took the most vulnerable first."</p> 
               <p>Ralynn scowled at Tali. "Then why's she still here?"</p> 
               <p>"Because!" Tali lifted her chin. "Even a chimera is more perceptive than you when it comes to strength of spirit. Maybe if you had three heads, you'd have enough brains to—"</p> 
               <p>Aberny flung his arms wide. "Enough. The beast caught us off guard and marked us for later. Can we focus on that?"</p> 
               <p>"Dumb boasts," Ralynn said. "In a fair fight, it doesn't stand a chance against me."</p> 
               <p>"Chimeras don't fight fair," Tali said. "And they're wickedly cunning."</p> 
               <p>"What do you know?" asked Ralynn.</p> 
               <p>The gnome tapped her cheek with a silver-painted nail. "Much! Most chimeras live in prides, hunting in groups to outnumber prey. This one could be a younger male or an outcast, and hunting more aggressively as it tries to establish dominance of its chosen territory. Oh, and they like shiny things!"</p> 
               <p>Aberny eyed her. "How've you learned all this?"</p> 
               <p>"Besides everyone around town talking for the past few weeks since the first deaths?" Tali drew herself up. "I always—always!—study my subjects in-depth. It's the only way I can properly convey their essence through my pieces."</p> 
               <p>"You learned the tongue of dragons in a few weeks?"</p> 
               <p>She sniffed. "Of course not. Languages are a form of art. I've immersed myself in many of them over the years."</p> 
               <p>"What of you, Aberny? With your investments..." Ralynn indicated the bodies with a flick of his eyes, "not paying off, want to renegotiate?"</p> 
               <p>Aberny hitched his shoulders back, trying to project his usual confidence, which had alarmingly fled. He'd thought himself sturdier than this. "The hunt continues." He slumped again. "But first, let's respect the dead."</p> 
               <p>They found a patch of soft earth and Aberny procured a small shovel from the supplies his deceased servants had brought along. Ralynn dug four shallow graves, and then they dragged the fallen over one by one. Tali surprised them by joining in, though she took care to only grab the bodies where blood or bile hadn't marred them.</p> 
               <p>Aberny and Ralynn took turns shoveling dirt over the holes, even though it proved more manual labor than the merchant had experienced in a long while. He'd sweated through his robe by the time he stopped to pray Desna's blessing, wishing the dead good fortune in the afterlife for their loyal—if short—service.</p> 
               <p>Ralynn rebuilt the fire and claimed the watch for the rest of the night, but the other two didn't return to their tents. Tali claimed inspiration for a piece she called "Foe by Firelight" left her too roused to sleep, though Aberny noted she kept well within the circle of firelight and sat a bit closer to the fighter than before.</p> 
               <p>For himself, Aberny settled on his stool and sipped wine to soothe his nerves, while pondering this ill turn of fortune. How could he, bereft of his guards, expect to triumph over such a vicious beast? He'd underestimated the creature, since reports had it picking off one or two victims alone. Now it appeared emboldened and loath to spare any threats to its territory.</p> 
               <p>Yet he'd always found a way to turn even the most dire circumstances to his benefit. This time, though, it wasn't just about recouping losses. If he considered the chimera a bandit as well as a beast, it put things in the proper perspective. It hadn't just attacked their party. It had robbed him, specifically; and no merchant worth his abacus allowed thievery without consequences.</p> 
               <p>He slugged back the last of the wine in silent oath to himself. So be it.</p> 
               <p>The scratching of Tali's sketching nibbled at his ears until just an hour before dawn, when she gave an enormous yawn and slumped, snoring against Ralynn's side. The fighter sighed, but didn't push her away. As the sun lit a candle on the horizon, Aberny rubbed his eyes, wishing he could follow the gnome to rest, but knowing it'd be a futile effort.</p> 
               <p>Once morning rose in full, he made them a quick, cold breakfast. Ralynn gulped his down and then jostled Tali awake for her portion, which she took with a grimace. Then they debated what to do with the tents and equipment.</p> 
               <p>"Leave it," Aberny decided, "except for any food we can carry. If the creature plans to return, we might not need to go far before picking up its trail. And we don't want to be overburdened if it ambushes us."</p> 
               <p>As the others prepared to head out, Aberny retrieved his staff, and then—after a moment's thought—took up one of the swords from a fallen guard.</p> 
               <p>Ralynn raised a slim eyebrow. "Planning to use that?"</p> 
               <p>Aberny gave an experimental swing, trying to awaken long unused arm muscles. "I was a caravan guard once, long ago. I didn't leave that profession entirely unscarred."</p> 
               <p>"You?" Tali asked, goggling.</p> 
               <p>He grunted. "During a trip through Cheliax, our caravan was ambushed by orcs. I alone survived, managing to get most of the goods to Kintargo in the aftermath. I then established my name based on my former master's reputation. Turned out I had an even better knack for it than he ever did." He tucked the sword into his robe's belt and thrust his staff toward the hills. "Onward?"</p> 
               <p>Ralynn smirked. "Still willing to brave the danger?"</p> 
               <p>"By all means. When it slaughtered my men, the chimera made this business rather... personal."</p>

               <p><span itemprop="description">As quickly as they receive them, clerks in the Grand Lodge of Absalom are processing the reports from field agents across the Inner Sea. Overall, the results are very promising, and Society leadership agrees that despite the outbreak of the Firth Mendevian Crusade, plans to travel to Jormurdun are proceeding smoothly.</span></p> 
               <p>Against this backdrop, the eight faction leaders have overseen their own projects and sent missives to their allies in the Pathfinder Society to update agents on their progress. You can read each faction head’s letter on the <a href="/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/pathfinder/pathfinderSociety/factionTalk">paizo.com messageboards</a>. When the time comes, ensure that you represent your faction proudly in the following scenarios, all released during the coming months of the Year of the Demon:</p>

               <p>Thanks for your participation in and feedback regarding the Year of the Demon. It’s exciting to see the check box results from reported scenarios. These not only help to steer the direction of our factions but also determine which NPCs might return in future scenarios as allies or as antagonists.</p>
