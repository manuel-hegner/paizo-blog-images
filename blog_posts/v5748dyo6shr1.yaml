  \    <blockquote> \n      <p itemprop=\"description\">Howdy, everybody. Paizo Publisher\
  \ Erik Mona here. I wanted to stop by the blog today to talk about some upcoming\
  \ changes to our Pathfinder Society and Starfinder Society scenario offerings in\
  \ the months ahead. Because I spent many years as an active organized play player\
  \ and GM before my publishing career and often tried to read the tea leaves behind\
  \ changes just like these, I want to go over the changes carefully to make sure\
  \ that no one draws the wrong conclusions.</p> \n      <p>Over the last year, our\
  \ organized play and editorial teams have taken a very close look at our department’\
  s production cycle, reported player data about how often our scenarios are used,\
  \ sales of individual scenarios, player feedback, and other information to get a\
  \ better sense of how we can best focus our editorial efforts. We identified two\
  \ key data points. One, the organized play team produces over 700,000 words of playable\
  \ content every year! Two, an adventure does not need to have the Society logos\
  \ to work well in the Society environment. With this information in mind, we’ve\
  \ come to some decisions about the path ahead that we’d like to share with you.\
  \ </p> \n      <p>Moving forward, we plan to slightly reduce the number of standard\
  \ scenarios released for both campaigns. Pathfinder Society will release 3 new scenarios\
  \ for the season launch in August and the standard 2 new scenarios in September,\
  \ November, and December. In October, we will release 1 new scenario.</p> \n   \
  \   <p>For Starfinder Society, we will produce the standard 2 new scenarios per\
  \ month in August and October, but will release only 1 new scenario in September,\
  \ November, and December. </p> \n      <p>Overall, we will see a similar pattern\
  \ in 2022, with slightly fewer scenarios for both campaigns (but at least 1 new\
  \ scenario a month for both campaigns, and more than that more often than not).\
  \ To help our community keep up to date, we will add a section to our monthly update\
  \ blogs with the upcoming production schedule.</p> \n      <p>Adjusting the number\
  \ of scenarios doesn’t mean a huge reduction in overall Society playable content,\
  \ as it allows us capacity to bring the popular Bounties program of self-contained\
  \ shorter adventures to the Starfinder Society campaign starting in January of 2022,\
  \ with six new Starfinder Bounties introduced over the course of next year, as well\
  \ as publish new four Pathfinder Bounties for level 3 characters over the same period.\
  \ </p> \n      <p>Additionally, we are focused on having sanctioning ready at release\
  \ for our popular new One Shot single-session characters-provided adventures for\
  \ Pathfinder Society and Starfinder Society play, with a half-dozen One Shots scheduled\
  \ throughout 2022. Bounties and One Shots provide a different play experience than\
  \ a standard campaign scenario. They are an important way to bring new players into\
  \ the game systems and provide a great springboard into the organized play community.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>What’s it all mean in the big picture? Is Organized Play in trouble?\
  \ Are Pathfinder and Starfinder failing? </p> \n      <p>No. It’s none of that.\
  \ Both campaigns are doing great and are an important part of Paizo’s present and\
  \ future. These changes are an attempt to better balance the breakneck pace of our\
  \ in-house editorial operation to improve quality overall, and to diversify our\
  \ adventure offerings to provide a wider variety of play experiences, ideally with\
  \ an eye toward adding more people to the player networks for both games. The more\
  \ people playing Pathfinder and Starfinder, the cooler stuff we can do to support\
  \ both games. </p> \n      <p>We are committed to providing the best, most fun,\
  \ most inviting and most inclusive organized play environment that we can. From\
  \ time to time, that’s going to mean shaking up the plan a little bit and adapting\
  \ to new opportunities. Rather than signs of trouble, these are in fact signs of\
  \ health, and represent efforts to grow and nurture what we have all created together\
  \ for these fantastic campaigns. </p> \n      <p>For an exciting look at some of\
  \ the upcoming plans for Starfinder Society and Pathfinder Society, check out our\
  \ landing pages for the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/starfinderSociety\">Year of\
  \ the Data Scourge</a> and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shp9?Pathfinder-Society-Year-3-Announcement\"\
  >Year of Shattered Sanctuaries</a> seasons!</p> \n      <p>Until next time, may\
  \ all your successes be critical!</p> \n      <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight:\
