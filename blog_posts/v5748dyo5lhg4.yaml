  \ \n    <p itemprop=\"description\"><i>In <a href=\"/products/btpy9dz2\"></a></i><a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy9dz2\">Forge of Ashes<i></i></a><i>, the dwarven warrior\
  \ Akina returns home to the Five Kings Mountains after years as a soldier and mercenary,\
  \ accompanied by Ondorum, her silent companion of living stone. What she finds there\
  \ is far from what she remembers: a disgraced brother, an obsessive suitor, and\
  \ a missing mother presumed dead. Yet the damage runs deeper than anyone knows,\
  \ and when Akina’s brother is kidnapped by ancient enemies from the legendary Darklands,\
  \ she and Ondorum must venture below the surface—and into danger as old as the stones\
  \ themselves.</i></p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <h2>Chapter Four: Contemplation\
  \ of Stone</h2> \n     <p>Ondorum watched the snoring dwarf for a little while after\
  \ Akina left. He looked for any sign that Brakisten might wake, or even be sensible\
  \ enough to work the door latch if he did. He studied Brakisten's twitches and briefly\
  \ wondered what he might've been like before drink, deception, and grief took such\
  \ a harsh toll. Little use, however, in questioning what might have been. Better\
  \ to focus on what could be.</p> \n     <p>Ondorum searched the rooms for stashed\
  \ alcohol, but the den lacked any hiding places he could discern. He guessed it'd\
  \ be a while yet before Brakisten woke. Perhaps he could use the time to explore\
  \ a bit on his own.</p> \n     <p>While he'd encountered other dwarves besides Akina,\
  \ he'd never visited one of their kingdoms before. What glimpses he had so far proved\
  \ fascinating. He'd been looking forward to meeting Akina's family—at least, the\
  \ brother and mother. She'd told him how her father had died while she'd been in\
  \ battle training, buried in an avalanche during a Kingtower Pass patrol. In the\
  \ years they'd traveled and fought together with the swords-for-hire, she'd occasionally\
  \ spoken of her home and remaining kin. Her tone had initially been dismissive,\
  \ but had grown increasingly wistful until her return had been inevitable. Her asking\
  \ him to come along had been one of the great joys of his existence, but he possessed\
  \ no certainty of how long it'd last.</p> \n     <p>Best to make the most of it,\
  \ then.</p> \n     <p>Believing it safe to stroll for a bit, he bowed to Brakisten\
  \ and prayed to Irori that the dwarf might have a soothed mind and soul when he\
  \ woke. Then he stepped outside and took a moment to orient himself. Fortunately,\
  \ he had an excellent sense of direction, a talent the mercenaries had often put\
  \ to use when navigating unknown territory.</p> \n     <p>As he wound through the\
  \ district, he admired the roads and bridges. The dwarves had fashioned well-situated\
  \ thoroughfares, yet their constructions retained the sense of having sprung whole\
  \ from the earth. Studying the dwarves themselves, he almost believed the legends\
  \ that their earliest ancestors had been formed of living stone with fire baked\
  \ into their hearts. He sensed their joy and peace in knowing who they were and\
  \ where they belonged—a peace he knew Akina no longer held. Even though she'd never\
  \ said it outright, he reckoned she'd hoped to regain that centering of herself\
  \ by coming home. Could she still, he wondered, despite the unfortunate beginnings?</p>\
  \ \n     <p>An inconsistency nagged him as he wandered. Something about the city\
  \ itself...</p> \n     <p>Ah! Of course. The light. He should've realized. Akina\
  \ said her people worked all hours, taking shifts to ensure the forge fires never\
  \ dimmed, the mining carts never rolled in empty, and the tunnels and buildings\
  \ never stopped being strengthened or lengthened. While Ondorum knew dwarves could\
  \ see in the dark just as well as he could, the artificial light displayed their\
  \ handiwork in far greater glory.</p> \n     <p>He paused on the corner of a four-way\
  \ intersection atop a rise. From here, he could see down one of the massive rifts\
  \ dividing the city. Structures appeared to be built into the depths of the rift\
  \ itself, with chain-and-pulley lifts providing transportation up and down. Mining\
  \ entrances? Homes?</p> \n     <p>He gazed upward and let himself feel the weight\
  \ of the cavern. Not a claustrophobic press like many humans or elves complained\
  \ of after spending time underground. To him, it offered a soothing weight, like\
  \ a warm blanket beneath a frigid sky.</p> \n     <p>It seemed a city an oread might\
  \ be right at home in. Oread culture was a loose thing, in itself. They had no central\
  \ government. No real inclination to congregate with others of their kind. Most,\
  \ like him, chose their own paths. He'd heard of other oreads finding homes among\
  \ dwarven settlements, their inclinations toward stone helping them blend in well\
  \ enough. He'd even heard of oreads and dwarves who'd married and had children,\
  \ though he and Akina had never discussed such. Not that they'd been talking much\
  \ lately.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"//static4.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-ForgeOfAshes-Akina.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static3.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-ForgeOfAshes-Akina_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n      <br><i>Akina doesn't control her temper, so her temper controls her.</i>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>Guilt cracked his concentration at that thought. He knew\
  \ Akina detested his self-imposed vow, sometimes opining that he must've taken it\
  \ just to provoke her. But did she realize how much it tormented him as well? Ever\
  \ since they'd first begun traveling together, he'd enjoyed the steady way they'd\
  \ drawn ever closer. Now he'd distanced them in a way neither of them could bridge.\
  \ In the pursuit of perfecting himself, did he now fail her?</p> \n     <p>Trying\
  \ to restore a more contemplative focus, he shut his eyes and visualized his<i>\
  \ </i>ki<i> </i>as a golden ball at the core of his being. Palms opened to the ground,\
  \ he imagined lines of ki stretching out into the stone, connecting him with the\
  \ essence of the city. A futile effort to gain a sense of the place, perhaps, since\
  \ he'd only seen a fraction of Taggoret, but all lessons began somewhere.</p> \n\
  \     <p>As he attempted to meditate, a memory of screams teased his thoughts. Past\
  \ mistakes and failures rose to taunt him, as they so often did. The golden ball\
  \ of ki turned to granite. He fought to corral the riot of sudden emotion and steady\
  \ his breathing, but everywhere he turned, regret threatened to overwhelm him. Akina.\
  \ The monastery. The village. All of them hurt or lost despite his best efforts.\
  \ The wrong words. The wrong actions. Yet he still struggled to know what he could've\
  \ done or said differently in the circumstances.</p> \n     <p><i>Irori, please.\
  \ I'm trying. Truly. I've ever believed yours is the hand that should guide my path,\
  \ but it can be so difficult to know which way you're pointing. Is Akina's solace\
  \ more important than my silence? Is my vow meant to be broken? Or is this a test\
  \ to refine both of us?</i></p> \n     <p>He waited, listening for an answer, memories\
  \ still haunted by screams. Then he opened his eyes, realizing some screams weren't\
  \ in his mind. A faint roar sounded nearby, followed by a cry and crash. Someone\
  \ in trouble?</p> \n     <p>He reached into his robe and drew out an iron rod no\
  \ bigger than his thumb. He carried a small collection of such metal rods and chips\
  \ to be employed when circumstances required. While he could fight decently enough\
  \ with empty hands, he knew better than to overlook the advantage of an extended\
  \ reach.</p> \n     <p>Calling on his elemental heritage, he let earthen power flow\
  \ through him and infuse the metal, giving it the potential to be so much more than\
  \ it appeared. The rod lengthened into a full quarterstaff. While it was a temporary\
  \ transformation, and one he could only repeat after a lengthy delay, it could help\
  \ if he needed to intervene in a scene of violence.</p> \n     <p>So armed, Ondorum\
  \ stepped out into the middle of the street, looking for the source of the disturbance.\
  \ A dwarf walking by jumped aside, fists cocked. Then he gave a grating laugh.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Flaming beards, boy. Thought you were a statue.\"</p> \n     <p>Ondorum\
  \ pointed down the road and cupped a hand to his ear. The dwarf frowned, but then\
  \ brightened.\"Oh, that's the Scarred Knuckles. Best fighting hole in all the mountains.\
  \ There's a tournament tonight. Was on my way, myself.\" He sidled up and nudged\
  \ Ondorum.\"My bet's on the Silver Skewer, but it'll be a good fight either way.\
  \ For some of us, blood gleams brighter than gold, eh?\"</p> \n     <p>Quarterstaff\
  \ tapping along, Ondorum fell in step with the dwarf, who talked as they went. The\
  \ dwarf didn't seem to notice the oread's failure to reply as he guided Ondorum\
  \ to one building and ushered him inside. The noise quadrupled in force, and Ondorum\
  \ tried to let the cacophony flow over and past him. At least two hundred dwarves\
  \ crammed into multi-tiered seats surrounding four sunken arenas. Each ring held\
  \ a pair of fighters. The crowd loosed another roar as one combatant hit the ground\
  \ and didn't move.</p> \n     <p>His dwarven escort cackled.\"Remember! All bets\
  \ on the Silver Skewer.\"</p> \n     <p>Others called out names such as The Haunch\
  \ and One-Nostril. Ondorum shifted through the crowd as the audience slapped and\
  \ pounded one another in revelry, celebrating with what would've been bruising—\
  or bone-breaking—force for many other races.</p> \n     <p>Ondorum's attention fixed\
  \ on a cage set off in a corner. At first, it appeared to contain nothing but darkness;\
  \ then the slightest movement suggested a figure huddled within. Ondorum got closer\
  \ until he discerned the captive.</p> \n     <p>Clad in filthy rags, the person\
  \ looked dwarven in shape and size. However, his skin was a dull gray, and what\
  \ hair remained in his beard hung in white patches. He lay curled up beside a chamber\
  \ pot, withered arms and legs weighed down by chains bolted to the stone wall. The\
  \ wrinkles and heavy folds of his forehead and cheeks made him seem practically\
  \ ancient.</p> \n     <p>Duergar. Ondorum had heard of the dwarves' fallen cousins\
  \ but never seen one before. By the look of him, this one had been kept there as\
  \ a spectacle for many years. The duergar stared out past the cage bars, dark eyes\
  \ unblinking, face slack.</p> \n     <p>Ondorum frowned, uncomfortable with seeing\
  \ any creature imprisoned. Akina had once entertained the mercenary band with tales\
  \ of the outcast race. Once dwarves themselves, they'd rejected the call of Torag\
  \ to seek the surface millennia ago. They'd remained below and, to survive in the\
  \ treacherous Darklands, sworn themselves to Droskar, the Master of the Dark Furnace.\
  \ Now the duergar continued to toil down in the Darklands, ruling their fell kingdom\
  \ in cruelty and malice.</p> \n     <p>After a few minutes, he moved on, realizing\
  \ he wasn't about to solve the ancient enmity between the two races with a little\
  \ sympathy for a prisoner. He approached one of the nearer rings and looked easily\
  \ over the heads of those crowding around it. The two fighters exchanged a barrage\
  \ of hits and kicks before stumbling back from each other. The brief pause gave\
  \ him a clear view of one bare-knuckled combatant and her platinum-streaked hair.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Akina.</p> \n     <p>The crowd might as well have vanished as he focused\
  \ on her in dismay. Her half-crazed eyes, the flex of her jaw, and the hunch of\
  \ her shoulders told him she rode the edge of fury. Ondorum gripped his staff, uncertain.\
  \ Even if he broke his vow to shout her name, his voice would be lost in the riot.\
  \ She always thought she could control her rage, and so often proved herself wrong\
  \ as she rode the swell up and over into temporary madness. The others here didn't\
  \ know the danger, and would find out too late.</p> \n     <p style=\"text-align:\
  \ center;\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n     <p>Akina howled in glee as her fist cracked across\
  \ her opponent's cheek, sending him somersaulting. Every landed blow meant more\
  \ coin added to the wagers on the bout. She didn't know her enemy's name. Didn't\
  \ care. She bounded after and forced him up against a wall to pummel his belly while\
  \ he beat at her skull. Might as well have been knocking stones against stones.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Here. She belonged here, dealing pain to any and all.</p> \n     <p>The\
  \ longer her blood boiled, the more the world altered around her. Her nostrils flared\
  \ as she picked out others by their sweat, by the auras of smoke clinging to them,\
  \ by their reeking fear. The air itself felt like a rich current of magma through\
  \ which she flowed as easily as thought, while those around her slogged and stumbled\
  \ and burned.</p> \n     <p>With an incoherent battle cry, her opponent sprinted\
  \ in. She took the hit and tangled fingers in his thick hair. Turning with his momentum,\
  \ she drove him face-first into the wall. He rebounded, and she threw her weight\
  \ into another slam. Then another. He went limp after the fourth, but she held him\
  \ upright and cracked bone to stone, wanting to smash his skull through and beyond.\
  \ Blood spattered her and the wall. He gargled in her grip as she reared back for\
  \ a final thrust.</p> \n     <p>A hand grabbed her shoulder. She dropped her victim\
  \ and spun, aiming a blow, but something slapped her fists aside and threw her off-balance.\
  \ As she recovered, the newcomer scooped up the fallen dwarf and threw him out of\
  \ the ring.</p> \n     <p>Akina shook bloodstained fists.\"No! I was winning!\"\
  </p> \n     <p>Cheated on the brink of victory. For a moment she thought she recognized\
  \ the new enemy, but then it didn't matter. Yet as she charged, he stood solid and\
  \ took her strikes as they came. Open palms intercepted her fists; his arms didn't\
  \ even as tremble at the hits. When she tried to grapple him to the floor, he stepped\
  \ aside and let her sweep past.</p> \n     <p>\"Stand still!\"</p> \n     <p>Each\
  \ missed attempt stoked the fires higher.</p> \n     <p>\"Stand—\" One moment to\
  \ the next, the flames in her belly turned to a block of ice. The cold weight of\
  \ it dragged her to her knees. She shook her head, hands planted, trying to rise.\"\
  No, I was winning...\" Quivering limbs refused to support her.</p> \n     <p>As\
  \ she collapsed, a pair of hands caught her. She blinked away the gray haze long\
  \ enough to focus on Ondorum before a curtain of ashes enveloped her.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>\"Sorry,\" she said.\"It's the only way I know how to pray.\"</p> \n    </blockquote>\
