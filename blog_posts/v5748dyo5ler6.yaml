  \ we released <a href=\"/products/btpy8x1o\"><i>Pathfinder Module: Fangwood Keep</i></a>\
  \ by veteran Pathfinder Society author Alex Greenshields. This adventure holds a\
  \ special place in my heart for a few reasons. First, on a personal level, it was\
  \ Alex who first ran me through a Pathfinder Society scenario (<a href=\"/products/btpy84k0\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Society Scenario #1: Silent Tide</i></a> way back in 2008) and he's\
  \ been a constant contributor to my other passion, the <a href=\"http://pathfinderwiki.com\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">PathfinderWiki</a>, for nearly just as long. It makes me happy\
  \ to see him get his first printed cover credit in a Pathfinder product, and on\
  \ such an amazing adventure, too!</span></p> \n    <p>Second, I've always been a\
  \ fan of adventures that provide the PCs lots of different options. When I was working\
  \ on this scenario with Alex, we wanted to make sure that it offered as many choices\
  \ as possible. For example, the adventure takes place in the Southern Fangwood,\
  \ on the ever-shifting border between warring nations Molthune and Nirmathas. It\
  \ was important to us to ensure that the PCs could be agents of either nation when\
  \ they set off on the adventure, making it easier for GMs to place the adventure\
  \ into their ongoing campaigns or for PCs for better integrate characters of varying\
  \ backgrounds into the plot.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb180\">\n     <a href=\"\

  \ one of the main objectives we set for ourselves was to provide written-in options\
  \ for players to take two different approaches to taking the adventure's eponymous\
  \ fortress. Some players love the thrill of combat and taking on imposing odds,\
  \ and for these players, a full frontal assault on the fortress is likely the most\
  \ fun approach. Other players like to use stealth, guile, and trickery to win the\
  \ day, and we made sure there were just as many opportunities for PCs to infiltrate\
  \ Fangwood Keep in secret and take the fortress one room at a time without raising\
  \ any alarms. Hollow walls, secret escape (or entry, in the PCs' case) tunnels,\
  \ and hidden doorways are just a few of the ways PCs can explore the tower without\
  \ tipping off the soldiers who guard it.</p> \n    <p><a href=\"/products/btpy8x1o\"\
