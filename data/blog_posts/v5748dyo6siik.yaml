  \ odd that I have not made any notes within the margins of the prophecies themselves.\
  \ It is certainly not for lack of opinions, but out of an abundance of caution;\
  \ some of the most heated debates that I have ever witnessed during my studies dealt\
  \ with the supposed impartiality of the researcher, with some believing that we\
  \ should be as unbiased as my fellow psychopomps in their judgments of souls in\
  \ the Boneyard and others noting that our beliefs influence everything we do, and\
  \ should be acknowledged and even used within the way we work. The arguments grew\
  \ heated more than once, and while it cannot be said for sure that they led to what\
  \ some call “The Dueling Quills Incident,” they certainly caused plenty of frayed\
  \ nerves.</em></p>\n      <p><em>This particular debate has taken on new meaning\
  \ for me now, though, in reading of one supposed divine death after another. Maybe\
  \ it is something I will grow out of one day, but it is hard not to be affected\
  \ by these, whether I am mourning the potential loss of the Lady I serve or learning\
  \ of the potential demise of a god I do not care for. I’m not sure I would ever\
  \ want to view them and feel nothing but analysis. Passion drove me to this work\
  \ and passion should be part of it—for all I know, that may even have been what\
  \ brought me to my Lady’s attention. Still, I will present the prophecy with no\
  \ further comment, and fear that once I have read it fully, even my small bit of\
  \ glee will dissipate. As always, momentary gains bring unexpected consequences.</em></p>\n\

  \      <h2>The Death of Urgathoa</h2>\n      <p>The feast is a sumptuous spread\
  \ of delights if that’s the sort of thing you like. Piles of sweets and meats and\
  \ cheeses, decadence on decadence, to celebrate a distant plague gone better than\
  \ expected. Urgathoa is smiling as the undead shovel down the food, the flavors\
  \ barely noticed in their urge to sate their hunger. It would all make Arazni sick,\
  \ if that was still a thing she felt, and if she wasn’t steeled by something greater\
  \ than revulsion. For all the gods Urgathoa hates, and all who hate her in return,\
  \ she hasn’t even bothered to secure her own protection, relying on the undead to\
  \ sniff out any intruder. Except they know Arazni’s scent. A tiny boon from all\
  \ her years forced into undead servitude, now sharpened to a weapon to take down\
  \ the god who dared to bring undeath to the unwilling.</p>\n      <p>Arazni moves\
  \ in shadow, and if the diners notice, they barely pause their latest gulp to see\
  \ her blade unsheathe. Urgathoa dies easily, falls lengthwise on the table, face-first\
  \ into a centerpiece of something rich and juicy. As panic and dismay begin to spread\
  \ throughout the Bloodrot, Arazni leaves the way she came, a vengeful shadow baring\
  \ teeth in something like a smile. Divinity is still a thing she’s learning to inhabit,\
  \ but this almost makes everything she’s suffered seem worthwhile.</p>\n      <p>Arazni\
  \ waits, for…something—some rest for those trapped in undeath, some halt to necromantic\
  \ work, some alteration in what had been a truly loathsome status quo. And there\
  \ are places in the world where she can see the fruits of her handiwork—the Whispering\
  \ Way is driven back, Geb’s Blood Lords struggle for control—until the undead start\
  \ to rise from any perished soul. Not all, but some, begin to turn without a necromancer’\
  s aid, and stagger from their resting places trying to fill their hunger. Without\
  \ Urgathoa to lend some order to the chaos, some dead stay locked inside their graves,\
  \ while others now reanimate with no real rhyme or reason, rising from their tombs\
  \ and slowly crawling off battlefields, horrified and terrified and sometimes all\
  \ too eager to see what unholy agenda their new bodies can pursue.</p>\n      <p>In\
  \ places where undead have always been a threat to life and limb, the champions\
  \ against them try their best to hold the line, not looking at the faces that are\
  \ suddenly familiar, comrades-at-arms turned into bodies cut down by their blades.\
  \ Some look to magic to protect the bodies of the newly-dead, but magic has its\
  \ limits, and others fall to the horror they once tried to quell. At least they\
  \ know how to respond, unlike those who are wrapped in grief, only to see a loved\
  \ one rise as some new transformation. Do you love or do you fear? Do you watch\
  \ or do you help? Do you wait or do you run and run and keep on running?</p>\n \
  \     <p>Some families go missing now. Some villages are overrun. Some cities bar\
  \ their crypts and add guard shifts to every other street. Some call undeath a blessing,\
  \ see the change as nectar from the gods. Some view it as a threat to something\
  \ they once lived and died for. Others search for patterns, narrow in on who or\
  \ what is to blame, let something they don’t understand consume their baser instincts,\
  \ and rain fire down on those they think have brought this new world forth.</p>\n\
  \      <p>Arazni owns what she has done, seeks out the help of other gods, but they\
  \ know just as little and have found themselves just as besieged, as undeath spreads\
  \ like the diseases Urgathoa once held dear, refusing to contain itself to one singular\
  \ plane. And as the numbers slowly rise, a flood that grows by sodden inches, one\
  \ undead soul at a time from Axis to the Boneyard, some say the Pallid Princess\
  \ watches from some place beyond undeath, relishing the moment like a feast to truly\
  \ savor.</p>\n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n       <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/a7d62ac8-7f03-00ef-f1f0-83fb8bf332e2/3200bed8-27d7-4a0c-b2e7-6b4750075a7e/EvolvingProhecyImage_Wk4_1300x2000.jpg\"\

  \ from every grave are one thing (and something that I know my Lady will not enjoy,\
  \ no matter how untrue this prophecy may turn out to be), Arazni’s direct role in\
  \ this cataclysm is not something I am quite sure how to parse. She has broken free\
  \ from her centuries of servitude as Geb’s unwilling lich queen, and in so doing\
  \ attained true divinity, a risen herald. With her newfound power, is she capable\
  \ of slaying a fellow god? Is this merely one facet of the unreliability of these\
  \ prophecies? Perhaps I should begin watching Arazni more closely, as some sort\
  \ of harbinger, a sign that this alone among the prophecies is true? Does she have\
  \ knowledge of this prophecy, and if not, is this something to warn her of? I will\
  \ be dusting off my copy of </em>What the Future Holds: The Ethics of Prophecy<em>\
  \ immediately. In the meantime, my Lady will know what to do with this. All I must\
