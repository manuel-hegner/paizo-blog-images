  artist: "as a result of a wandering monster result. In Pathfinder, I'm going to\
    \ try to make sure that whenever we have a dragon appearing in the adventure,\
    \ he or she has a story. Especially, as in the case of Pathfinder #5, when the\
    \ dragon appears on the cover. The white dragon on the cover is Arkrhyst—called\
    \ Freezemaw by the Shoanti—an old white dragon who has lived on Rimeskull for\
    \ 50 years. In his youth several centuries ago, Arkrhyst was a great and hated\
    \ enemy of the Shoanti; his raids on the nomads of the Velashu Uplands and the\
    \ western Storval Plateau were legendary, and many of those tribes still sing\
    \ of these dark times, and of the countless heroes who sought out his home on\
    \ Rimeskull to defeat him. None accomplished this goal, but as Arkrhyst grew older,\
    \ his urge to raid grew less. Content now with the reputation he earned, he sleeps\
    \ for years at a time on his considerable store of treasure, dreaming of his youthful\
    \ rampages. Of course, Freezemaw's only one of many menaces that wait for PCs\
    \ brave enough to seek out the legendary dungeon of Runeforge in Pathfinder #5—\
    but he's certainly one of the adventure's more memorable villains! James Jacobs\
    \ Pathfinder Editor-in-Chief"
