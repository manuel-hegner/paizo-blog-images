  \ \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">The skittermander at the\
  \ counter flexed his fingers and grinned. “What’ll it be, nufriend?”</p> \n    \
  \ <p>“Nufriend?” Tono smirked. “Every night I come here and order the same thing,\
  \ and suddenly you ain’t know me, Henig?” </p> \n     <p>Henig let out a deep chortle,\
  \ as if it were emerging from his feet and rising out of his body. “No, no! It’\
  s just that…” He leaned over the counter, inches from Tono’s face. “You know how\
  \ the streets can be,” he whispered. “Funny business afoot, and all that. Don’t\
  \ want anybody making off with your whereabouts, gree?”</p> \n     <p>Tono gave\
  \ a gentle nod, the neon of the night glancing off her chrome dermal plate. She\
  \ had been working on this side of the surface for only eight months, and even she\
  \ had made enough enemies to know better than for any of them to know where she\
  \ slept. If just one of their associates ever knew she also was willing to drive\
  \ this far into the city just for a bowl of noodles and a conversation in the middle\
  \ of the night, she’d be face down in the alley beside the shop with a fist-sized\
  \ gap in her belly. Tono winced at the thought—she hadn’t scrounged enough recent\
  \ work to pay for another check-up, let alone replace a cybernetic augmentation.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Strangely, her justification for habitually returning was twofold. For\
  \ one thing, this part of the city was where all her informants were. For another,\
  \ she grinned wide at the chef and said what she always said whenever he worried\
  \ about her getting in trouble because of him. “You ain’t gotta worry ‘bout me,\
  \ Hen… only nice people come by your shop.” </p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ He chuckled again. “Then how come you’re here so often?” </p> \n     <p>Tono nodded\
  \ in amused agreement before ordering a large bowl of the house special. She tried\
  \ not to bring her work—or her difficult demeanor—to Henig’s shop whenever she could\
  \ avoid it, but she knew she wasn’t easy to deal with. He probably didn’t know what\
  \ she did, but word got around quickly. Which is why she regretted having to ask\
  \ her next question. “Have you seen Mirai about?” </p> \n     <p>Henig raised an\
  \ eyebrow. “Mirai? She in some kind o’ trouble?” </p> \n     <p>The apertures in\
  \ Tono’s eyes tensed. She noticed it right away. She always trusted that Henig was\
  \ smarter than the goofy, kindhearted cook he presented as. “You know something.”\
  \ </p> \n     <p>Henig’s lower limbs continued pulling dough into thick noodles\
  \ as he spoke. He glanced down pensively, and then toward the street, as if worried\
  \ someone would find him. “Two folks in black came up the block asking for her,\
  \ but I hadn’t actually seen her come out to the market in days. Made it sound like\
  \ they’d been to her apartment… didn’t find nothing. If you’re asking for her…”\
  \ He frowned. “Gotta think she’s on the run for some reason, gree?”</p> \n     <p>“\
  But why?” </p> \n     <p>“You really askin’ me?” Henig shot her a wicked glare.\
  \ “The same reasons you’d run. Is she in trouble?” </p> \n     <p>“I don’t know.\
  \ I asked her to check something for me. Just a chat with some folks at Fythe Dynamics\
  \ for a client… a routine interview with Sepp Yolen. I thought it was nothing…”\
  </p> \n     <p>“Politely, I’ll ask.” Henig looked right at her. “Is it ever <em>nothing</em>\
  \ with either of you?” </p> \n     <p>Tono struggled for the next words and resigned\
  \ herself to just a shake of the head. </p> \n     <p>“Exactly.” He lit the stove\
  \ behind him without looking. “I wish I had more to give you. Just… black suits,\
  \ cold eyes, no manners. And one of ‘em, a lashunta woman, had a scar across the\
  \ lip like so.” He made a diagonal downward motion across his own face, then shrugged.\
  \ “Mean folks. Don’t want to see those two in a hurry again.”</p> \n     <p>Tono\
  \ tilted her head. “The suits… d’you figure they were top-notch?” </p> \n     <p>“\
  Maybe some of the most drift threads I’ve ever seen,” he said, finally casting an\
  \ eye on the simmering stock pot behind him. “Probably thought I couldn’t tell the\
  \ duds concealed armor. Figured they were well-paid hired hands of some sort.”</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“Any insignias on the clothes?”</p> \n     <p>“No patches. Just a silver\
  \ pin on the collar.” He wiped a large blue ceramic bowl and placed it in front\
  \ of her. “Why?” </p> \n     <p>Tono smirked. “No reason at all. I’ll be back in\
  \ a bit. And my food better be waiting.” </p> \n     <p>“Whatever you say, friend.”\
  </p> \n     <p>Tono got up and stretched before strolling back down the busy market\
  \ street beside the shop. This part had to be done carefully, she thought. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>People tended to be very alert when they were tailing someone, after\
  \ all. </p> \n     <p>Tono was paranoid, to be sure, but the more precisely Henig\
  \ described this lashunta woman, the more obvious her presence became, just a few\
  \ dozen feet away, watching them talk the entire time. She may have followed Tono\
  \ the whole way, in fact, or even watched her leave her apartment. Without making\
  \ eye contact, Tono sized the woman up. Slim, tall, lithe—the kind she figured made\
  \ her coin in close combat rather than a gunfight. Even more careful, then.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Tono strolled toward where the agent stood—against the wall of a nearby\
  \ bookstore—and squinted against the window. The lashunta didn’t flinch, but Tono\
  \ knew better. Silence lingered in the air between them, mere inches apart. In that\
  \ moment she knew they were both playing a calmness that would ready them for conflict\
  \ at any moment. From that close, she could make out the vague imprint of a pair\
  \ of blades under her jacket. She knew her appearance gave away her own game, as\
  \ well: the quickdraw pocket in the right leg of her pants, wide enough for a sidearm,\
  \ stored a static arc pistol specifically for moments like these. </p> \n     <p>“\
  See something you like?” the lashunta said casually. </p> \n     <p>Tono didn’t\
  \ even glance up at her. “So far, nothing seems especially interesting.” </p> \n\
  \     <p>“Oh, yeah?” The lashunta’s voice rose—the telltale sign that Tono had the\
  \ slightest upper hand. “Hoping to find something in particular?” </p> \n     <p>“\
  A challenge would be nice.” </p> \n     <p>Before the agent could react, Tono reached\
  \ for the agent’s arm and twisted it behind her back, pinning the lashunta against\
  \ the wall. Tono drew her pistol and aimed it at the small of the agent’s back,\
  \ right beneath where her trapped fingers curled into a fist. </p> \n     <p>“What\
  \ is wrong with y—”</p> \n     <p>“A great deal, actually,” Tono said. “But at the\
  \ moment, the fact that I’m being tailed has me particularly on edge.”</p> \n  \
  \   <p>“You’re being silly, lady!” </p> \n     <p>“Yeah?” Tono only needed to lift\
  \ the agent’s arm for the tension and pain to increase. “Let’s check, then. Walk.”\
  \ </p> \n     <p>They slowly made their way back to Henig’s counter, their demeanors\
  \ strangely calm for the circumstances. When Henig saw her again, his eyes widened.\
  \ “Yeah…” he said meekly. “That’s one of ‘em.”</p> \n     <p>“Was she nice to you?”\
  \ </p> \n     <p>It took him only beat to pick up on the game Tono was playing.\
  \ “Not one bit,” he said.</p> \n     <p>“See, my friend Henig here seems mild-mannered,”\
  \ Tono said, nearly as low as a whisper. “But people tend to forget that he cuts\
  \ his meat with the same sword that sears it, so I wouldn’t annoy him.” </p> \n\
  \     <p>“And what happens if I annoy you?” the agent said with a smirk. </p> \n\
  \     <p>“Scary part is, even I don’t know yet. Now talk.” </p> \n     <p>“I got\
  \ nothing to—” </p> \n     <p>Henig slowly drew a skyfire sword from a drawer beneath\
  \ the counter and brought it an inch from the lashunta’s face, just beneath the\
  \ eyebrow. “Fine by us either way,” he said, igniting it just enough for a brief\
  \ flicker of heat to grace her skin. “I hope you hate your face as much as we do…\
  ”</p> \n     <p>“Wait.” Tono sensed the faintest shift in the agent’s mood from\
  \ composure to fear and back, but Henig would never see it. </p> \n     <p>“Fythe\
  \ sent you?” </p> \n     <p>The agent hesitated before nodding. “The girl. She asks\
  \ too many questions. We just had to nab her, make her afraid, you know? But…” </p>\
  \ \n     <p>“You haven’t seen her either. So why are you following me?” </p> \n\
  \     <p>“Because…” The agent sighed. “The chairman asks us to do his wetwork when\
  \ he doesn’t want to think about something. When he wants it to disappear. But Mirai?\
  \ He won’t stop asking about her. He wants a meeting now, to ask for a job.” </p>\
  \ \n     <p>It was Tono’s turn to be afraid. If Sepp Yolen wanted to meet, it could\
  \ only mean trouble.</p> \n     <p>“You have a cruiser?” Tono growled in the agent’\
  s ear. </p> \n     <p>The lashunta nodded. </p> \n     <p>“Good. We’re gonna take\
  \ a ride. But first…” Tono reached into the woman’s jacket pocket, pulled out a\
  \ credstick, and tossed it on the counter. “You’re gonna pay for my dinner.”</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“That would be the nice thing to do, gree?” Henig said. “And only nice\
  \ people come here.”</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p style=\"font-weight: bold;\
