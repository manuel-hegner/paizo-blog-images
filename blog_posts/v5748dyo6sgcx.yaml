  \    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">It's time for another report from\
  \ the Order of the Amber Die! This time they give us a peek at their table as they\
  \ ran through Part 5 of <i>Doomsday Dawn</i>, \"The Heroes of Undarin\"! As usual\
  \ with these blogs, if you haven't played or read this and don't want to see any\
  \ spoilers, turn away now!</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p>Following our interactions\
  \ with authors from <span><a href=\"http://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo670md?Order-of-the-Amber-DieDoomsday-Dawn-Playtest\"\
  >Part One</a></span>, <span><a href=\"http://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6sg9p?Order-of-the-Amber-DieDoomsday-Dawn-Playtest\"\
  >Part Two</a></span>, <span><a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgb4?Order-of-the-Amber-DieDoomsday-Dawn-Playtest\"\
  >Part Three</a>,</span> and <span><a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgc1?Order-of-the-Amber-DieDoomsday-Dawn-Playtest\"\
  >Part Four</a></span> of the playtest, the time had come to face Jason Bulmahn once\
  \ again. Our GM did much to invest us in what was essentially a wave-by-wave grinder,\
  \ and we learned later that this was also to prevent us from developing the notion\
  \ that in this scenario our deaths were likely inevitable. We were told our start\
  \ time had been adjusted to match the time of day during which the adventure began\
  \ (late afternoon), and that we'd likely be going late into the night. While Adam\
  \ will often employ <span><a href=\"https://syrinscape.com/\">Syrinscape</a></span>,\
  \ ambient tracks, or his own themed soundtracks, this time he had us rocking out\
  \ to combat the entire evening with such as one of our ESPN favorites, \"300 Violin\
  \ Orchestra,\" and NIN's \"The Day the World Went Away.\" Our love of immersion\
  \ and role-playing is clear from many of our reports over the years, but you don't\
  \ have to look far in the Order to find players who are also up for a dice-throwing,\
  \ hand-slapping brawl that will go twelve session hours.</p> \n     <h2>The Party</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>Going in, we were told that we'd be playing hardy characters accustomed\
  \ to facing terrible enemies in the Worldwound. We actually had quite a bit of freedom\
  \ with character creation and wanted to accomplish a couple of things: acquire more\
  \ data on a paladin and cleric played at higher levels, and spotlight both the highest\
  \ level single-classed wizard and fighter of our playtest run. Listed with the names\
  \ of each player on the team is the year each became a member of the Order (when\
  \ a player has reached 100 hours at our table).</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\"\

  \     <p>With the sun setting across a ruined temple deep in the Worldwound, we\
  \ prepared to defend sacred ground from an onslaught of demons and undead. We had\
  \ several situational tools at our disposal, and foremost among these was the ability\
  \ to use an ancient stained glass window to bring Desna's will upon our enemies.\
  \ Second was an altar that allowed each of us to use the god's blessing for one\
  \ well-timed reroll of a d20. Between these and the assortment of terrain and antagonists\
  \ featured, this was a true test of tactical skill in an edition we weren't very\
  \ familiar with—thus an exceptional challenge we won't soon forget. What Bulmahn\
  \ has created with this scenario is now a trial for all Order members to aspire\
  \ to.</p> \n     <p>We're having to adjust to the new numerical norms in our favorite\
  \ game, which is also part of what makes any playtest interesting. When a treachery\
  \ demon tossed down a 44 initiative to open a combat jaws dropped, and we realized\
  \ just how far we were from the days of the previous edition of Pathfinder. Go ahead\
  \ and combine that with 29 TAC attacks against our wizard from a pack of dread wraiths,\
  \ resulting in 15 misses. How about a single channel from our cleric, ripping 198\
  \ damage against four opponents?</p> \n     <p>Not only were divvying powerful items\
  \ an important aspect of party construction for this scenario, it was at 12th level\
  \ that potent items from the new era of Pathfinder truly began to shine. Don't take\
  \ our word for it though, let the numbers above tell the story of a paladin's unbreakable\
  \ shield and a fighter's holy sword.</p> \n     <h2>Character Deaths</h2> \n   \
  \  <p>The end wasn't pretty. When the players on this team joined the Order, we\
  \ heard stories from the 1980s and 90s about past members who saw their beloved\
  \ characters devoured by a certain demilich during five different playthroughs of\
  \ the \"Tomb of Horrors.\" If it gives you an idea of how much our GM reveres demiliches,\
  \ he chose one for his Paizo messageboards avatar—that same one from the \"Tomb\
  \ of Horrors.\" Worse yet, Adam can now add four characters from this era of the\
  \ Order to his gruesome tally. At least we'll have some stories for the fire pit\
  \ about our wizard's <i>ray of frost</i> being reflected back at him as a critical\
  \ hit, another character critically failing against a <i>maze</i> spell, and watching\
  \ our cleric's body turn to dust when the demilich trapped his soul.</p> \n    \
  \ <h2>Current Situation</h2> \n     <p>We learned afterward that this was the scenario\
  \ in which we were supposed to die. That's fine, we understand and appreciate the\
  \ value of providing data from our destruction to help produce a better game. It\
  \ still stings a bit though, as any TPK would. Dropping to a 2-3 performance thus\
  \ far in the playtest, we're now left with no choice if we want to finish with a\
  \ winning record: We'll have to run the table!</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <p>Follow\
