  \ Earlier this month, we announced Starfinder Society Year 5: <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shz7?Starfinder-Society-Year-5-Announcement#25\"\
  >Year of Redemption’s Rise</a>. While the previous blog post is packed full of information\
  \ on the year itself, today we’re focusing on one of the two new factions you can\
  \ expect to see in the Year of Redemption’s Rise: the Advocates!</p> \n      <h2>The\
  \ Advocates</h2> \n      <p>When Zigvigix, former leader of the Exo-Guardians, emerged\
  \ from their recent convalescence to find the Starfinder Society splitting apart\
  \ at the seams, their heart broke. They had suffered more than most during the Data\
  \ Scourge, but they still sympathized with those around them: the citizens whose\
  \ lives were upended or cut short and the Starfinders who felt shame and suspicion.\
  \ Determined to mend the widening rifts between agents and offer them the support\
  \ they needed to recover, Ziggy founded a new faction: the Advocates. </p> \n  \
  \    <table class=\"image\" align=\"left\"> \n       <caption align=\"bottom\" style=\"\

  \ at the viewer.\"></a></td>\n        </tr> \n       </tbody>\n      </table> \n\
  \      <p>Ziggy’s passion, heart, and understanding caused the faction’s ranks to\
  \ quickly swell. Members of the Advocates are sometimes referred to as “Heartloves”\
  \ as a nod to both their mission and Ziggy’s favorite band (Strawberry Machine Cake).</p>\
  \ \n      <p><b>Faction Leader</b>: Zigvigix (LG host shirren soldier) was a long-standing\
  \ member of the Exo-Guardians. They suffered severe injuries prior to the Scoured\
  \ Stars, which prevented them from taking part in that ill-fated expedition. Despite\
  \ being overwhelmed with survivor’s guilt, Zigvigix took up leadership of the remaining\
  \ Exo-Guardians. During the Data Scourge, they were taken prisoner by the Scourge’\
  s perpetrator, who later used the shirren’s cybernetics to infect Guidance with\
  \ a corrupting virus. Zigvigix tore out their own cybernetic implants to prevent\
  \ the digital infection from spreading and has only recently recovered from the\
  \ ordeal. Though Zigvigix admits they have much healing to do, they take comfort\
  \ in their relationship with Celita, their favorite sugar-pop music, and the support\
  \ of their colleagues and community.</p> \n      <p><b>Motto</b>: We’re here for\
  \ you!</p> \n      <p><b>Year 5 Goal</b>: The Advocates aim to heal the widening\
  \ rifts between factions, unite the squabbling Starfinder agents into an accepting,\
  \ loving, and supportive community, and encourage the Starfinder Society to do good\
  \ throughout the Pact Worlds and beyond.</p> \n      <br clear=\"all\"> \n     \

  \ Fernando Mesquita</p> \n      </div> \n      <br> \n      <p><b>Boons</b>: Like\
  \ all our factions, the Advocates have a slate of unique boons available for purchase\
  \ with Achievement Points by members of the Advocates faction with the appropriate\
  \ amount of Reputation. Today we’re revealing three of these boons! Note that these\
  \ boons are not yet final and may change slightly before release.</p> \n      <p><b>Loyal\
  \ Friend (Slotless Boon)</b>:<br> Your strong bonds of friendship help center your\
  \ thoughts. You gain a +1 morale bonus to saving throws against the confused condition.\
  \ When you have the confused condition and would be forced to attack an ally, you\
  \ instead do nothing but babble incoherently.<br> <b>Requirements</b>: 5+ Reputation\
  \ with Advocates<br> <b>AcP Cost</b>: 2</p> \n      <p><b>Protector’s Offense (Slotless\
  \ Boon)</b>:<br> You’ve trained to protect your allies from harm as often as you\
  \ protect yourself. When you successfully strike a target with a melee attack using\
  \ a weapon with the block special property and increase your AC against that target,\
  \ your adjacent allies gain a +1 enhancement bonus to their AC for 1 round against\
  \ melee attacks from that same target. This bonus only applies as long as they remain\
  \ adjacent to you.<br> <b>Requirements</b>: 15+ Reputation with Advocates<br> <b>AcP\
  \ Cost</b>: 4</p> \n      <p><b>Determined Medic (Slotless Boon)</b>:<br> You’ve\
  \ trained for innumerable emergency situations and are a capable combat medic in\
  \ a pinch. Once per adventure as a standard action, you can treat a willing, adjacent\
  \ creature to remove one of the following conditions: frightened, nauseated, paralyzed,\
  \ shaken, sickened, or staggered. This doesn’t end the effect that caused the condition,\
  \ and the target can regain the condition from any source as normal.<br> <b>Requirements</b>:\
  \ 25+ Reputation with Advocates<br> <b>AcP Cost</b>: 4</p> \n      <p>I hope you’\
  ve enjoyed this sneak peek at the upcoming Advocates faction! Come back at the end\
  \ of the month when we reveal information on the Cognates!</p> \n      <p>Wishing\
  \ you all the best, Starfinders! Take care of each other out there.</p> \n     \
