  http://cheapass.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Cheapass Games</a> is back! Having printed\
  \ nothing new since 2005, they are hitting the ground running with a full new line\
  \ of games. Their first new offering is a deluxe reprint of their excellent 2001\
  \ card game, Unexploded Cow.</span></p> \n     <p>The game is set in Europe in 1997,\
  \ where savvy entrepreneurs have discovered two problems with a common solution:\
  \ mad cows in England, and unexploded bombs in France. You will buy cow cards, arrange\
  \ them in a herd, march that herd through France, and \"disable\" unexploded bombs.\
  \ It's fun for pretty much everyone, even the cows. Because they are quite mad.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Unexploded Cow was a great game before, and it's been completely updated\
  \ and revised in this new edition by designers James Ernest (<i>Kill Doctor Lucky,\
  \ Button Men</i>) and Paul Peterson (<i>Guillotine, Smash Up</i>). The new edition\
  \ has art by Cheyenne Wright (<i>Girl Genius Web Comic, James Ernest's Totally Renamed\
  \ Spy Game</i>), with new rules that make the game smarter and better than ever.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><b>Rules Synopsis:</b> On each turn players draw cards, play cards,\
  \ and then roll a die to see which cow finds a bomb. The cards are \"cows\" and\
  \ \"events,\" and you can play as many cards as you want. The price for each card\
  \ goes into the pot, and when cows explode, you earn money from the pot. If you\
  \ blow up your own cow, you also earn the City card, which can mean more money or\
  \ special game effects. When the last city is taken, the game goes into \"sudden\
  \ death\" where cows explode until the pot is empty. Then, the player with the most\
  \ money wins!</p> \n     <p>Unexploded Cow is fast, funny, and fabulous. And it's\
  \ coming soon!</p> \n     <p><a href=\"http://youtu.be/pwxs8_iO19Y\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >Check out how to play Unexploded Cow on YouTube.</a></p> \n     <p><b>From James\
  \ Ernest:</b></p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p>Unexploded Cow was always one of\
  \ the \"evergreen\" Cheapass Games, and we were sad to take it out of print in 2006.\
  \ Starting up Cheapass Games again has been really exciting, and I'm thrilled that\
  \ Unexploded Cow will be the first game in the new line.</p> \n      <p>Cheapass\
  \ isn't all about high-priced games, as you know. We've also got three white-boxed\
  \ games coming out this June, as well as a bunch of free print-and-play games online\
  \ at cheapass.com. Now there's a Cheapass Game for every budget!</p> \n      <p>Unexploded\
  \ Cow was funded by Kickstarter back in September 2012, and it's just getting back\
  \ from the factory now. We're thrilled at how it came out, and we're hoping for\
  \ the same success with Deadwood Studios, USA, which is <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cheapassgames/deadwood-studios-usa\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">on Kickstarter right now</a>. If you want to help us out, please\
