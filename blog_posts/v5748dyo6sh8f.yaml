  \ be launching a brand new Pathfinder Second Edition mini-series audio adventure.\
  \ This actual play will be available exclusively on our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/FindthePathVentures\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">YouTube channel (youtube.com/FindthePathVentures)</a> and will\
  \ release weekly on Wednesdays.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a\

  \ \n     <p><b>What is Tales from Darkmoon Vale?</b></p> \n     <p>For our first\
  \ foray into recorded second edition, we’ll be playing through a converted version\
  \ of <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy82r0\"><em>Hollow’s Last Hope</em></a>.\
  \ This GameMastery adventure was written by Jason Bulmahn and F. Wesley Schneider\
  \ and released by Paizo in 2007 as part of Free RPG Day, which means the adventure\
  \ is available for free on Paizo’s website! Hollow’s Last Hope also happens to be\
  \ the first ever adventure set in the world of Pathfinder. It is part of a series\
  \ of adventures all set in the town of Falcon’s Hollow.</p> \n     <p>To quote from\
  \ the back of the adventure: </p> \n     <blockquote> \n      <p>The plague has\
  \ come to the town of Falcon's Hollow, and not even the town's priest can abate\
  \ its wretched course. With the coughs of the sick and the wails of the dying echoing\
  \ through town, the local herbalist uncovers a cure, but she needs some brave heroes\
  \ to retrieve the ingredients. Finding the cure means risking the dangerous Darkmoon\
  \ Vale.</p> \n      <p>[...] Do the heroes have the skill and courage to find the\
  \ cure in time?</p> \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>Ross Scoggin has lovingly converted\
  \ <em>Hollow’s Last Hope</em> from 3.5 to Pathfinder Second Edition, and will be\
  \ gamemastering this mini-series. Ross has many years of experience GMing, and will\
  \ bring a fresh take on masterful storytelling to the Find the Path Ventures lineup.\
  \ </p> \n     <br> \n     <p><b>Who is playing in Tales from Darkmoon Vale?</b></p>\
  \ \n     <p>We will have five players on the show: Heather Allen, Jessica Peters,\
  \ Jordan Jenkins, Rachel Sandidge, and Rick Sandidge. Yes, you read that right!\
  \ Rick will be making his debut as a <em>player</em> on Find the Path in this series.</p>\

  \ alt=\"\"></a>\n      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></p>\n     </div> \n     <p>Heather\
  \ is playing Celestine, a half-elf street urchin rogue who was raised on the streets\
  \ of Falcon’s Hollow. </p> \n     <p>Jessica is playing Clove, a human herbalist\
  \ barbarian who is trying to navigate being an adult for the first time while working\
  \ to find a cure for the people in the town.</p> \n     <p>Jordan is playing Amaranthe,\
  \ an elf scholar wizard who has come to Falcon’s Hollow to pay his respects at the\
  \ funeral of an old friend.</p> \n     <p>Rachel is playing Astrea, a halfling laborer\
  \ fighter who works as a forge worker while secretly working against the Lumber\
  \ Consortium. </p> \n     <p>Rick is playing Grim, a dwarf scout champion who tends\
  \ an apple orchard on the outskirts of town while caring for his daughter-in-law\
  \ and granddaughter.</p> \n     <br> \n     <p><b>Why YouTube?</b></p> \n     <p>Tales\
  \ from Darkmoon Vale will be our first mini-series adventure, and we feel it is\
  \ a prime opportunity to try something new and different. Giving this series a home\
  \ on our YouTube channel ensures it won't get lost in the Find the Path Podcast\
  \ feed and gives us the chance to experiment with a new format.</p> \n     <p>As\
  \ an added bonus, we will be hosting a Live Premiere of the first episode on May\
  \ 27th at 7pm CDT so that listeners can join in for live commentary from the cast!\
  \ This lines up with PaizoCon Online, which felt like a perfect time to get together\
  \ with fellow fans of Pathfinder to celebrate a new entry into the Pathfinder Second\
  \ Edition podcast world.</p> \n     <br> \n     <p><b>TL;DR</b></p> \n     <p>The\
  \ first three episodes of <em>Tales from Darkmoon Vale</em> will release May 27th,\
  \ 2020 at 7pm CDT on YouTube (youtube.com/FindthePathVentures). Then expect a new\
  \ episode every Wednesday until we finish this mini-series. Check out our YouTube\
  \ channel for character previews and more information about the show!</p> \n   \
