  \ \n   <p class=\"date\">Wednesday, February 20, 2008</p> \n   <p>In early November\
  \ Paizo challenged amateur game designers from around the world to show off their\
  \ skills in a revolutionary online contest called RPG Superstar. From more than\
  \ 850 submitted wondrous items, celebrity judges Erik Mona (Paizo's Publisher),\
  \ Wolfgang Baur (Editor-in-Chief, Kobold Quarterly), and Clark Peterson (President,\
  \ Necromancer Games) narrowed the field to 32 would-be RPG Superstars, and further\
  \ rounds have narrowed that field in the intervening weeks.</p> \n   <p>The final\
  \ round asked the four competing finalists to propose a 32-page GameMastery Module\
  \ for ultimate publication by Paizo as the Grand Prize of RPG Superstar. Contestants\
  \ Clinton Boomer (Macomb, IL), Rob McCreary (Prague, Czech Republic), Jason Nelson\
  \ (Seattle, WA), and Christine Schneider (Neu-Isenburg, Germany) responded with\
  \ four excellent proposals, each worthy of publication in its own way.</p> \n  \
  \ <p>But there can be only one RPG Superstar, and in the end after the celebrity\
  \ judges had a chance to offer comments and criticism and the general public had\
  \ their final vote, one proposal stood out as the clear winner.</p> \n   <p>Congratulations\
  \ to Christine Schneider for her victorious proposal, \"Clash of the Kingslayers.\"\
  \ Here's a brief description of the adventure from <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/community/gaming/rpgsuperstar/previous/2008/round6/clashOfTheKingslayers\"\
  >Christine's winning RPG Superstar submission</a>:</p> \n   <blockquote>\n    This\
  \ module will set the heroes against the gods' blind wrath in defence of a dwarven\
  \ city-kingdom. During the course of the adventure the PCs will cross swords with\
  \ dwarvish valkyries, fight giants freed from the underworld, unravel an ancient\
  \ secret, and explore a remote monastery. What starts as a casual dungeon crawl,\
  \ will turn into a frantic pandemonium as the monastery is imbued with divine life\
  \ to wage war on the city the heroes might choose to protect or even aid to destroy.\
  \ Ultimately, the PCs get the chance to slay not one, but three kings in attempt\
  \ to end this madness and write the final lines of an ancient tragedy. <i>This adventure\
  \ is intended for characters of 10th-level and will yield enough experience to advance\
  \ them to 11th-level or even half-way to 12th-level.</i>\n   </blockquote> \n  \
  \ <p>As RPG Superstar's Grand Prize, Paizo will contract Christine Schneider to\
  \ write \"Clash of the Kingslayers,\" which we will release as GameMastery Module\
  \ S1 in January, 2009. </p> \n   <p>But you don't have to wait until January to\
  \ reserve your copy! Head over to the new <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy81qp\">\"Clash\
  \ of the Kingslayers\"</a> product page here on paizo.com to preorder your copy\
  \ of Christine's winning adventure! If you already subscribe to GameMastery Modules,\
  \ \"Clash of the Kingslayers\" will arrive as part of your ongoing subscription.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>On behalf of judges Wolfgang Baur and Clark Peterson as well as the whole\
  \ Paizo Publishing family, congratulations to Clinton Boomer, Rob McCreary, Jason\
  \ Nelson, and Christine Schneider.</p> \n   <p>Remember those names, folks. You'll\
  \ be hearing from all of them in the months and years to come. Though the contest\
  \ produced only one true RPG Superstar, it also turned up a huge number of fresh\
  \ voices we plan to work with for a long time to come.</p> \n   <p>And I'd like\
  \ to offer one final thanks to you, the readers of paizo.com and to anyone who submitted\
  \ an entry to this year's <a href=\"/rpgsuperstar/previous/2008\">RPG Superstar</a>\
  \ contest. The event has been enormously popular here on the site, and even the\
  \ wizened old judges learned a thing or two along the way. Something this successful\
  \ is certain to return, so in the meantime sharpen your pencils and start working\
  \ on some wondrous items.</p> \n   <p>The next RPG Superstar is only a few months\
  \ away!</p> \n   <p>Erik Mona<br> Paizo Publisher</p> \n  </blockquote> <!-- tags:\
