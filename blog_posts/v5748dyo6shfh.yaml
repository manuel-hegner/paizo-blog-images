  \ Throne Adventure Path</em></a>, Pilts Swastel, the insane, self-proclaimed Emperor\
  \ of Old Korvosa, carries a <a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=265\"\
  ><em>Rod of Wonder</em></a>. We’re told that “each time he successfully uses the\
  \ device, he shrieks in delight and offers impromptu commentary on the rod’s results.”\

  \ version of <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws8?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Curse-of-the-Crimson-Throne-Adventure-Path\"\

  \ on as a possible level 3 boon. We eventually renamed it Wondrous Rod to avoid\
  \ running afoul of the SRD-OGL police. We even more eventually cut it to the floor,\
  \ forgotten until now. </p> \n    <p style=\"color:blue;\">While card count is the\
  \ ultimate reason it was cut, another reason it was cut is because Chad and I could\
  \ never agree on its design. Two cards enter, no cards leave. Or maybe a few cards\
  \ eventually leave. Let’s find out.</p> \n    <br clear=\"all\"> \n    <p style=\"\
  color:brown;\">Before we get to the Curse version, though, I actually tried to build\
  \ a version as potential Loot for <em>Rise of the Runelords</em>, but it got cut\
  \ pretty quickly. As I recall, it functioned somewhat like a random version of RotR’\
  s Emerald Codex, but with more words. I recall that it had most of the downsides\
  \ we later disliked in the Curse versions included here, and Mike was pretty sure\
  \ that Vic would prefer to stab me with a pen rather than try to fit it onto a card.</p>\

  \ 13px;\">Keith’s original <em>Crimson Throne</em> version.</p> \n    <p style=\"\
  color:brown;\">The first Curse version generated one of four random effects. </p>\
  \ \n    <p style=\"color:brown;\">(An aside: I looked hard for a way to replicate\
  \ the RPG effect that boils down to “target is encased in a 10-foot cube of lime\
  \ Jell-O.” The functionality is in there with “evade the card,” but it lacks a certain...\
  \ flavor.)</p> \n    <p style=\"color:brown;\">At this point, Keith and I were working\
  \ together, but on different coasts, so my playtest groups (hello, awesome playtesters!)\
  \ were somewhat separated from Keith’s (hello, other awesome playtesters!). While\
  \ we talk frequently, and we use the playtest forums to coordinate multiple groups\
  \ (hello, other other awesome playtesters!), sometimes small changes can get missed.\
  \ In this case, early feedback from out west suggested that it felt weird for the\
  \ item to be nearly always beneficial. </p> \n    <p style=\"color:brown;\">Let’\
  s talk about upside/downside effects for a minute. In general, PACG abstracts a\
  \ whole raft of actions down into a (relatively!) simple resolution method. In a\
  \ typical Pathfinder RPG combat encounter, you might easily make dozens of decisions\
  \ about your actions. In PACG, though, it just feels terrible to try something unpredictable\
  \ and get something non-functional—something much closer to “we failed a fight”\
  \ than “it took an extra round.” If we want these sorts of unpredictable effects\
  \ in the game—and we know that many people enjoy them—we have to be careful about\
  \ the costs.</p> \n    <br clear=\"all\"> \n    <p style=\"color:blue;\">Because\
  \ PACG characters can carry a limited number of boons in their hands and decks,\
  \ I feel fairly strongly that it had to measure up to the quality of other comparable\
  \ boons. So let’s break down what it does.</p> \n    <p style=\"color:blue;\">¼\
  \ of the time, it adds 1d8-1 to your checks against the card. Undeniably good ⅞\
  \ of the time, ⅛ of the time a waste of a card.</p> \n    <p style=\"color:blue;\"\
  >¼ of the time, you draw 1d4-1 cards. Risky if you’re down to only a few cards or\
  \ your turn is about to end. Helpful for this encounter... occasionally. Let’s call\
  \ this arguably good ¾ of the time, though truly beneficial maybe only ⅜ of the\
  \ time, ¼ of the time a waste of a card.</p> \n    <p style=\"color:blue;\">¼ of\
  \ the time, you heal 1d4-1 cards. Note there’s no “may,” so that can screw up other\
  \ things you might be doing like recharging cards in some order or avoiding drawing\
  \ something you don’t want to. Still, arguably good ¾ of the time, but almost never\
  \ beneficial for this encounter, and ¼ of the time a waste of a card.</p> \n   \
  \ <p style=\"color:blue;\">¼ of the time, you get a new encounter. Or evade a story\
  \ bane, which might make you reluctant to use the card at all against a story bane\
  \ you think you can defeat. Let’s call that ¼ good, ¼ neutral, ¼ bad, and ¼ a waste\
  \ of a card.</p> \n    <p style=\"color:blue;\">Obviously, all of that math is super\
  \ handwavy, but I add it up as roughly 15/32 good, 8/32 neutral, 2/32 bad, and 7/32\
  \ waste of a card. Looks random enough to me, even if it won’t occasionally turn\
  \ you or your target permanently blue. And if you’re into Gambling, the thrill of\
  \ the unknown itself might just make it all upside for you. </p> \n    <p style=\"\
  color:brown;\">At some point fairly early on, Keith’s original version got changed.\
  \ I’m not sure exactly when; I had to dig way back into the document history to\
  \ find his original version. Something like half a year earlier, it had been replaced\
  \ with the version that we eventually decided to cut from the set:</p> <a href=\"\

  \ align=\"left\" style=\"padding-right: 10px; padding left: 10px;\" alt=\"Before\
  \ acting, freely recharge to summon a spell and either banish it, or play it and\
  \ discard this card instead. You may use your Arcane or Divine skill in place of\
  \ any other skill when using the summoned spells' powers\"></a>\n    <p style=\"\
  font-size: 13px;\">The last version before it was cut.</p> \n    <p style=\"color:brown;\"\
  >Obviously, this wanted to be a Gambling item. We wanted it to be at least somewhat\
  \ unpredictable. We also wanted it to feel at least potentially better for magic-wielding\
  \ types than for (say) drunken chaos lovers (and lovers of chaos); that’s why it\
  \ let you use Arcane or Divine to “make it work”—this let us cross the Arcane/Divine\
  \ streams, so to speak.</p> \n    <p style=\"color:brown;\">Earlier wordings of\
  \ this card were built as a wand, and thus used the bury/recovery concept, but the\
  \ rod can be used at-will, which saved us some text on an already-wordy card. We\
  \ settled on “freely recharge” to get you a cheap-and-easy look at the effect, and\
  \ “discard instead” to give it a reasonable cost if you kept the effect. Had it\
  \ survived, we probably would have considered ways to get it back into your deck\
  \ even if you kept the summoned spell effect.</p> \n    <p style=\"color:brown;\"\
  >Generating a semi-random effect without potentially locking you out of the encounter\
  \ proved to be complicated to write out, especially around the timing: you need\
  \ to use the card very early, since the rules mandate that “setting the type of\
  \ check” comes first. This led us to start with “before acting.” We also didn’t\
  \ want the card to be “floating around” for any longer than necessary, since that\
  \ can lead to scary and/or confusing special cases—witness the variety of ways that\
  \ “display” effects end. In particular, we wanted to make sure that you couldn’\
  t <em>keep</em> the spell (something that is right for the Emerald Codex but wrong\
  \ for the Rod of Wonder). The concept was clear, though, and that’s good enough\
  \ for playtesting, especially early on, where it’s likely that Keith or I are present.</p>\
  \ \n    <br clear=\"all\"> \n    <p style=\"color:blue;\">Unfortunately, that last\
  \ version has a couple major flaws. There’s a timing issue, where you want to summon\
  \ a spell early in the encounter then play it at some later point in the encounter.\
  \ As written, you can’t use, say, Force Missile, since you can’t play it for your\
  \ combat check while you’re still “before acting.” Also, a random summoned spell\
  \ is <em>really</em> random. Your chance of getting something helpful dwindles very\
  \ rapidly, especially for non-caster characters. Vic also notes that the wording\
  \ wants “summon and banish” to be a thing, but the game’s rules don’t actually cover\
  \ that. Obviously, if we hadn’t cut it, we’d have tried to address those flaws.\
  \ But, since I liked my version better, I just left a note to do that, left the\
  \ alternate version in our sheet, and moved on with life. And when it came time\
  \ to put together the final card list, we already had more than we needed without\
  \ this one. </p>\n    <p style=\"color:blue;\">Let’s pretend we hadn’t had card\
  \ count issues, though, and think about addressing the playtesters' complaints.</p>\
  \ \n    <p style=\"color:blue;\">In order to make the “summon a spell” bit work\
  \ better, we need to clarify that you summon the spell early in the encounter, and\
  \ just have to use it sometime before the end of the encounter. Ideally, from my\
  \ perspective, we also don’t weight it entirely towards casters by just treating\
  \ your Arcane or Divine as something solid like 1d12+5 for this card. Even more\
  \ ideally, we make it less randomly useless by reducing the cost of using it (perhaps\
  \ it reloads) or by increasing the chance it’s useful (draw more than 1 spell).\
  \ Or summon something other than spells. Chad has some other ideas there...</p>\
  \ \n    <p style=\"color:brown;\">We definitely get into opinions here, but… my\
  \ take on the upside/downside tradeoff is that the card should <em>sometimes</em>\
  \ do good (or even great) stuff, and if it doesn’t, it’s usually enough for the\
  \ downside to be “opportunity cost”—that is, you put the card in your deck, got\
  \ it into your hand, didn’t discard it for damage or feed it to a saltbox/character\
  \ power/location close, and then chose to play it. In that world, if it doesn’t\
  \ help you, at least it didn’t also hurt you. The key to this is that it can’t stop\
  \ you from doing whatever else you might have available. This makes it a fun card\
  \ to try out even when you have other options, and if you find yourself with your\
  \ back against a wall, maybe you’ll get lucky.</p> \n    <p style=\"color:brown;\"\
  >This led us to the following version, a rough recreation of an idea that we were\
  \ spitting back and forth before we decided to cut the card and focus our efforts\
  \ elsewhere:</p> \n    <p style=\"color:brown;\">Display this card, and secretly\
  \ make a pile of 5 new boons of your choice under it. While displayed, you may reveal\
  \ a random card from the pile, then you may freely recharge or freely reload this\
  \ card to use that boon's effect. Then, return the revealed boon to the box.</p>\
  \ \n    <p style=\"color:brown;\">This idea evolved from a random boon concept—\
  initially, 1 new boon from a fixed list. “Weapon, armor, spell, and item” felt reasonable,\
  \ but since the rod was doing the work, it made sense storywise (to me, anyway)\
  \ for it to allow summoning a temporary ally, and from there, you might as well\
  \ also put blessings on the table. Like the previous “summon a spell” version, it\
  \ felt like an intuitive way to phrase a mostly random effect. Letting you choose\
  \ the types of boons gave you some agency, but not knowing what they were until\
  \ the last moment still felt (I theorize) unpredictable. It also leaned into the\
  \ new concept in the <em>Core Set</em> and <em>Curse of the Crimson Throne</em>&gt;\
  \ that your vault would contain higher-level boons—back in the RotR days, the most\
  \ you could hope for is to get that shiny new card of your current adventure deck\
  \ number (or, as we call it now, “#”), but here you might actually drop that Meteor\
  \ Swarm a couple levels early. Delicious.</p> \n    <p style=\"color:brown;\">Unfortunately,\
  \ there are some problems with this version, as Keith wisely points out:</p> \n\
  \    <p style=\"color:blue;\">That version, of course, has not been developed—at\
  \ all. Let’s go behind the curtain for a second on doing that.</p> \n    <p style=\"\
  color:blue;\">“New boons of your choice” is likely to cause confusion, so it’d probably\
  \ want to be “types of your choice”. </p> \n    <p style=\"color:blue;\">The timing\
  \ of when you can use it is still a bit up in the air. Nothing seems to be limiting\
  \ you from looking at the cards when not in an encounter.</p> \n    <p style=\"\
  color:blue;\">Combine those two problems together, and you’ve encouraged people\
  \ to choose 5 allies or blessings and use them for explores. Every round. Eep!</p>\
  \ \n    <p style=\"color:blue;\">So, let’s take a stab at a revision:<br> Display.\
  \ Secretly shuffle a new weapon, spell, armor, item, ally, and blessing into a facedown\
  \ pile next to this card.</p> \n    <ul style=\"color:blue;\"> \n     <li>When a\
  \ bane or boon is encountered, you may flip the top card of the pile. During the\
  \ encounter, you may summon and play the flipped card. At the end of the encounter\
  \ or after it is summoned, banish the flipped card.</li> \n     <li>At the start\
  \ of your turn, recharge this card and banish the pile.</li> \n    </ul> \n    <p>Okay,\
  \ now it’s time for some editing. Unless there’s a good reason, cards begin “[action\
  \ you take to play the card] to [effect that happens immediately on playing].” And\
  \ displayed cards use the words “while displayed” to separate effects that happen\
  \ immediately from effects that you can play later. Also, “secretly” is not a game\
  \ term—I know the designers want it to mean that nobody should know what the new\
  \ cards are, but it could be misconstrued to mean that the person assembling the\
  \ pile can know but should keep it “secret” from the other players. (That really\
  \ wouldn’t be a very PACG thing for the designers to do, but we still need to cut\
  \ off that possibility.) It’s clear that the designers also intended for “secret”\
  \ to block the rule that allows you to look at your displayed cards, but that needs\
  \ to be more explicit. Next, we use the word “pile” for faceup groupings of cards\
  \ that can be looked at and (usually) reordered at will, and “stack” for facedown\
  \ groupings of cards that (usually) may not be looked at or reordered. The phrasing\
  \ “When a bane or boon is encountered” is unnecessarily passive, and also makes\
  \ it easy to miss that you can flip a card from the stack on someone else’s encounter.\
  \ Finally, the word “summon” is backed with a lot of rules, and most of them shouldn’\
  t apply here—most notably, summoning a card that’s already in play creates a copy\
  \ of it that ceases to exist when it’s no longer needed <em>without affecting the\
  \ original</em>, and that’s really not what they want to happen here. It also caused\
  \ the unnecessary complication with “at the end of the encounter or after it is\
  \ summoned”—all that really matters is that the card ends up banished regardless\
  \ of where it ended up during the encounter, and that’s easily said. So: </p>\n\
