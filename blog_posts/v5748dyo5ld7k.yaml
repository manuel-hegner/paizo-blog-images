  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">Friday, March 2, 2012</p> \n    <p>One of the best parts\
  \ of working at Paizo is getting to see the brand new art fresh as it arrives in\
  \ the office. When a new Wayne Reynolds cover painting makes its way to the art\
  \ department, editors and developers flock to the big monitors to check out the\
  \ latest masterpiece. It's become a sort of ritual around here.</p> \n    <p>Five\
  \ years ago, when we first launched the Pathfinder Adventure Path, we marveled as\
  \ each new volume brought a fresh take on a classic fantasy monster. Wayne's goblins\
  \ on the very first Pathfinder cover (flavored by James Jacobs's insane portrayal\
  \ in the text) immediately conveyed our plans for the new Pathfinder product line—\
  delivering a fresh new take on the classic themes and monsters of fantasy gaming.\
  \ </p> \n    <p>In <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/riseOfTheRunelords/v5748btpy80e4\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventure Path #3, “The Hook Mountain Massacre,”</a> author Nicolas\
  \ Logue cranked the “fresh new take” into overdrive in his portrayal of ogres as\
  \ monstrous inbred hillbilly brutes. Wayne Reynolds gave Nick's ogres a puppet-like\
  \ look that pushed the creepiness even further. </p> \n    <p>Just as we'd done\
  \ with the goblins in volume #1, we wanted to give Pathfinder's ogres a distinctive\
  \ take, and a distinctive visual look. Nick and Wayne delivered, creating an adventure\
  \ that remains one of the most memorable and unsettling of Pathfinder's entire run\
  \ to date.</p> \n    <p>You'll get a chance to play this great adventure (or play\
  \ it again) in July with the release of the <a href=\"/products/btpy8mqq\">Rise\
  \ of the Runelords Adventure Path Anniversary Edition</a> hardcover. The Rise of\
  \ the Runelords Pathfinder Battles prepainted miniatures set will support the campaign,\
  \ with tons of miniatures inspired by images from the adventures.</p> \n    <p>Including\
  \ three amazing ogres!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20120202-Ogre.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20120202-Ogre_360.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n   \
  \ </div> \n    <p>Up first is the uncommon Ogre, your general rank-and-file maniac.\
  \ Like all three ogres in the set, this handsome gentleman comes directly from Wayne\
  \ Reynolds's cover of “The Hook Mountain Massacre,” and he's never looked better.\
  \ Don't tell the <a href=\"/products/btpy8qji\">Ogre</a> from <a href=\"/products/btpy8mq6\"\
  >Heroes &amp; Monsters</a>, but he's the runt of the litter when placed next to\
  \ his, um, kin from Hook Mountain!</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a\
  \ href=\"/image/content/Blog/20120202-OgreBrute.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20120202-OgreBrute_360.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>YEE HAW! Look out for this here big fella\
  \ with the huge club! We call him the Ogre Brute on account of him swinging around\
  \ that big stick, but he works just fine as a rank-and-file warrior. He's an uncommon\
  \ like his brother.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"/image/content/Blog/20120202-JaagrathKreeg.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/Blog/20120202-JaagrathKreeg_360.jpeg\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\
  \    </div> \n    <p>On Hook Mountain, it takes a strong ogre indeed to keep all\
  \ the family in line. In this set, that duty falls to the brutal Jaagrath Kreeg,\
  \ a rare miniature with a leering smile and lust in his beady little eyes. I can\
  \ say with authority that your players will love killing these guys, and you'll\
  \ love putting them out on your game table. </p> \n    <p>Details on the release\
  \ date, format, and price of the Pathfinder Battles Rise of the Runelords set are\
  \ still being solidified by our partners at WizKids.</p> \n    <p>And in late-breaking\
  \ far-future news, I now have a pretty good idea what will be in the NEXT Pathfinder\
  \ Battles set. I can promise exciting Pathfinder Battles previews at this time in\
  \ this space for many, many more months to come!</p> \n    <p>Erik Mona<br> <i>Publisher</i></p>\
