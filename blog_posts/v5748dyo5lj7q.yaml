  > \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">October scenarios always present an interesting\
  \ challenge because they coincide so well with Halloween yet are also early enough\
  \ in the season that I'm itching to develop the yearlong metaplot further. In the\
  \ past we've had some creepy October adventures like <a href=\"/products/btpy9986\"\
  ><em>Hall of the Flesh Eaters</em></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy9gww\"><em>To\
  \ Judge a Soul, Part 2: Karma Reclaimed</em></a>, but we've never had one with explicit\
  \ Halloween imagery. This time, I carved out a piece of the Season 8 schedule like\
  \ a chunk of pumpkin flesh from a cheerful jack-o'-lantern, tentatively naming the\
  \ adventure \"No seriously, Halloween.\" Linda and I didn't know quite what the\
  \ plot would be until we combined it with another concept that had been percolating\
  \ in our collection of madcap ideas. Then it all came together so beautifully that\
  \ Linda couldn't resist writing <a href=\"/products/btpy9oij\"><em>Pathfinder Society\
  \ Scenario #8-06: Reaping What We Sow</em></a> herself. If we follow the jack-o'-lantern\
  \ analogy, Linda is the candle—so often a cheerful source of light and warmth. From\
  \ within the haunted depths of a jack-o'-lantern fortress, however, her creative\
  \ energies shine with a truly sinister radiance. In this Tier 1-5 adventure, the\
  \ PCs travel to a small town in northern Galt on a mission of peace and redemption,\
  \ yet it can so quickly become a tragedy of blood and tears. Come for the Shelynite\
  \ pumpkin-carving festival! Stay for the legacy of vengeance and terror (with notes\
  \ so a GM can lighten the mood or play up the horror as befits the audience)!</p>\

  ></a>\n     <br> <i>Illustration by Giorgio Baroni</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>The\
  \ concept of an evergreen 1st-level adventure dates back to the First Steps adventures,\
  \ and with <a href=\"/products/btpy92ci\"><em>The Confirmation</em></a> in Season\
  \ 5, it turned into something of a yearly tradition to release another evergreen\
  \ adventure near the end of the calendar year. This has worked really well, providing\
  \ players of all experience levels an infinitely replayable scenario designed to\
  \ let the GM change several components to enhance the experience. This year, we\
  \ made two big changes before we reached out to Andrew Hoskins to write the next\
  \ evergreen adventure. First, we've changed the level, as <a href=\"/products/btpy9oik\"\
  ><em>Pathfinder Society Scenario #8-07: From the Tome of Righteous Repose</em></a>\
  \ is a Tier 3-7 scenario replayable for all of those levels. This helps address\
  \ one of the big concerns that there are lots of low-level adventures—not that that's\
  \ a bad thing—yet comparably fewer adventures that help a PC travel beyond the Tier\
  \ 1-5 range.</p> \n    <p>Because we expect #8-07 will see a lot of play, we also\
  \ aimed to increase the replayability beyond that of its evergreen predecessors\
  \ by varying not only the creatures involved but also the location and the plot\
  \ itself. The adventure allows the PCs to travel to three different locations and\
  \ face off against one of four Major Threats, each of which has an assortment of\
  \ possible Linked Threats (i.e. lieutenants and favored minions). On top of that,\
  \ there are sundry additional monsters, traps, and hazards that a GM can use to\
  \ populate the dungeons, each of which varies depending on whether the site appears\
  \ in Lastwall, Ustalav, or the Hold of Belkzen. Don't fret though, as GMs just need\
  \ to prepare what they plan to run, not every option. With Andrew Hoskins' writing,\
  \ Linda's development work, and the guidance of our newest in-world venture-captain\
  \ Shevar Besnik, you're in for many great adventures to come.</p> \n    <p>John\
