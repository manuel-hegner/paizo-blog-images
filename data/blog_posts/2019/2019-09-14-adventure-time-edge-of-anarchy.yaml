  \ an adventure path. We’ll start with Edge of Anarchy, the first <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws8?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Curse-of-the-Crimson-Throne-Adventure-Path\"\
  >Curse of the Crimson Throne</a> adventure, but there are plenty more Adventure\
  \ Paths after that. Each blog will include anecdotes from design and suggested options\
  \ for changing the difficulty of scenarios or spicing up replay. I invite you to\
  \ “Play It Your Way” my way. It’s fun! (Warning: Many of these suggestions increase\
  \ the complexity and/or difficulty of the game, so are most appropriate for experienced\
  \ players!)</p>\n              <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n               <a href=\"\

  \              <p>In Curse of the Crimson Throne, each adventure is associated with\
  \ a specific Harrow suit, so consider adding the Harrows wildcard that corresponds\
  \ to the Harrow suit for that adventure. For Edge of Anarchy, that’s the Harrow\
  \ of Keys. If you don’t want to just increase the difficulty by adding a wildcard,\
  \ you could make the game a little easier by starting each scenario with a free\
  \ exploration of the Base and making the Base not close if it’s out of supporters.\
  \ That’s an easy way to make the supporters a lot more accessible to the whole group,\
  \ which might be more fun for some groups.</p>\n              <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ Path's introductory scenario is 1★: Haunted Fortunes. It’s adapted from (and shares\
  \ its name with) the first part of the first chapter of the RPG Adventure Path.\
  \ I think it’s my favorite introduction to an RPG Adventure Path: Each character\
  \ is invited to think of some reason to hate a despicable criminal, Gaedren Lamm,\
  \ then gets to rescue a bunch of orphans on the way to bringing justice to him.\
  \ Drawn together by this mutual hatred and a mysterious fortune-telling, you instantly\
  \ create a party and dive right into play. When I ran it for my wife, her character\
  \ had two reasons to hate Lamm: he’d kidnapped her and her twin sister, and he’\
  d fed my wife’s character to his alligator. (Don’t worry: she got better. Sort of.\
  \ She also eventually found her sister. Sort of.)</p>\n              <div class=\"\

  \              <p>For this scenario I’d additionally consider any of the Perils\
  \ wildcard Wearisome, the Onslaughts wildcard Impoverished, or the Perils wildcard\
  \ Hostile (in roughly increasing order of difficulty). Wearisome isn’t too painful\
  \ at this level, but it does keep people’s turns from getting too long. Impoverished\
  \ lets you start with a better hand, at the cost of losing some cards and being\
  \ closer to death; not ideal, but also not too bad in your first scenario. Hostile\
  \ makes a lot more checks a lot more dangerous, so is a good pick for those seeking\
  \ a real challenge. Villain scenarios can also often use an extra location to increase\
  \ difficulty for experienced groups, so I’d add the next location on the list; if\
  \ you’re a group of 6, I’d add Abandoned Shacks.</p>\n              <div class=\"\

  \              </div>\n              <p>The next scenario is 1A: A City Gone Mad.\
  \ The villain here, Verik Vancaskerkin, doesn’t actually know about the dastardly\
  \ deeds of the thugs working for him, so if you manage to find the Evidence or talk\
  \ him into surrendering, you get a bonus ally and blessing for your trouble. Which\
  \ is great. Apparently it’s news to Verik that people calling themselves “The Cow\
  \ Hammer Boys” and operating out of a shop called “All The World’s Meat” at the\
  \ address “22 Stirge Street” were up to no good, where “no good” is selling people\
  \ meat. No, not selling people meat—selling people meat. Cannibalism. (I’m not sure\
  \ how that term works if you’re an elf eating a dwarf, though.) When I ran the RPG\
  \ and the PCs reported what they found to Verik, I assumed the proper reaction to\
  \ “Sir, the men have been moonlighting as assassins who turn people into ribeyes.\
  \ Also, how was dinner last night?” would be shocked bewilderment followed by vomiting.</p>\n\
  \              <p>I’d recommend the Perils wildcard Deadly here. I also like adding\
  \ a location (Alley for 6 characters). After that, I’d use any of Wearisome, Impoverished,\
  \ or Hostile, especially if you didn’t use them in Haunted Fortunes.</p>\n     \

  \ href=\"https://paizo.com/paizo/faq/v5748nrupch3h#v5748eaidgsn5\">Before playing\
  \ 1B: The Ambassador’s Secret, please observe its FAQ.</a></p>\n              <p>The\
  \ next scenario is an example of the ‘Solve the Mystery’ style scenario, where you\
  \ get free examinations that let you move cards around between locations while you\
  \ try to deal with Trigger barriers. I made the first test scenario of this type\
  \ for <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy9g8v\">Season of the Righteous 3</a>,\
  \ based on a concept I’d intended for this very path. I got to experiment with the\
  \ format a bunch more in other seasons, especially Season of the Plundered Tombs.\
  \ This scenario also led to my favorite testing anecdote ever: After the monster\
  \ Giant Fly was shuffled randomly into the location Spider Nest, the tester commented\
  \ “Either a bad idea for the fly, or it's off to get revenge for its kind,” to which\
  \ another tester asked “Well, how big are the spiders?” I supplied the above picture,\
  \ and got a prompt response of “Bad idea then.”</p>\n              <p>The Perils\
  \ wildcard Ablaze, dealing Poison damage instead of Fire, is a very thematic (albeit\
  \ painful) option for this scenario. To increase the difficulty, consider shortening\
  \ the first scenario power to just “At the end of your turn, you may examine the\
  \ top card of your location,” or changing the final phrase to “then put that card\
  \ on top of a random location.” Requiring an additional Evidence (by removing the\
  \ “or equal to” from the second scenario power) is also a solid option.</p>\n  \
  \            <p>Scenario 1C: The Dead Warrens can easily be the toughest scenario\
  \ in the adventure. This is true for thematic reasons and also because it was originally\
  \ the final scenario of the adventure. For story and pacing reasons, we wanted to\
  \ keep the chase after Trinia and the execution together.</p>\n              <p>The\
  \ Perils wildcard Confusing is a perfectly thematic choice for this Derro-filled\
  \ scenario. I also like the Onslaughts wildcard Monstrous, but I’d require that\
  \ all of the monsters have the Undead trait (you’ll need to find them before building\
  \ locations). If you’re playing on Legendary and haven’t increased # to 2, this\
  \ scenario could really use it since level 2 has a bunch of Undead.</p>\n      \

  Flow chart for resolving a city chase\"></a>\n               <p style=\"font-size:\
  \ 13px;\">Chase rules can get a little wacky in both the RPG and ACG.</p>\n    \
  \          </div>\n              <p>Scenario 1D: Kingkiller is one of several ways\
  \ we’ve run “chase” scenarios. In the RPG, you often make choices about which way\
  \ to go, such as “leaping between rooftops” or “balancing on the plank that leads\
  \ across” that let you use different skills and mix up the difficulty of options.\
  \ The location Rooftop’s power to choose between two barriers whenever you encounter\
  \ a barrier is entirely inspired by this mechanic. This scenario can be pretty quick\
  \ and easy, which might feel nice for anyone who had a tough time with the previous\
  \ scenario.</p>\n              <p>On the other hand, if you’re looking for more\
  \ of a nail-biter, I’d encourage at least one of two modifications to this scenario\
  \ to increase difficulty: First, remove the scenario’s automatic closing from defeating\
  \ the Fugitive. This means that you’ll have to defeat a barrier to close each Rooftop\
  \ location, and if you fail, closing will require either emptying it or shuffling\
  \ the Fugitive back into it. It really changes up the feel of the chase. Second,\
  \ when the Fugitive is defeated and is shuffled into another location, I’d instead\
  \ shuffle the Fugitive and a new barrier into a stack, then shuffle each into a\
  \ random location (different locations if possible).</p>\n              <p>That’\
  s more than enough for this blog. I can probably do Adventure 2 more succinctly,\
  \ right?</p>\n              <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height:\
