  \ \n     <p><b>Augmentation</b> Magitech<br> <b>Level</b> 10<br> <b>Price</b> 18,000<br>\
  \ This tasteful adamantine armature installed within your throat and mouth and linked\
  \ to your brain hides a collapsible cannon capable of firing powerful reality-altering\
  \ shells. When installed, a <em>head cannon</em> grants a +2 circumstance bonus\
  \ to the Fortitude save against a wound critical hit effect that targets the brain\
  \ (provided your species’ brain is in your head [provided your species thinks with\
  \ its brain]). As a standard action, you can open your mouth wide to use the <em>head\
  \ cannon</em> to make a ranged attack against a single creature’s KAC within 60\
  \ feet. This cannon counts as a heavy weapon for proficiency purposes and deals\
  \ 2d12 piercing damage. Upon rolling the damage, you can attempt a DC 16 Will saving\
  \ throw to exert your belief over how badly your target was damaged; if you succeed,\
  \ you can roll an additional d12 of damage. After you fire the head cannon, you\
  \ take a –2 penalty to the DCs and skill checks for language-dependent effects for\
  \ 1d4 rounds as your mouth returns to normal size and the gun cools down. Once you\
  \ have fired the <em>head cannon</em>, you can’t shoot it again until you’ve rested\
  \ for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points, though you can spend 1 Resolve Point\
  \ at any point to recharge the gun immediately.</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left:\

  \     <p>This dashing travel- (and beer-) stained feathered robe is the result of\
  \ magic experimentation gone awry. Dared to create a robe that would continually\
  \ cast <em>feather fall</em> during a brainstorming session at a local pub, a young\
  \ wizard got the enchantment wrong. Instead of a robe that would let its wearer\
  \ float through the air, they got….this:</p> \n     <p>When you first invest the\
  \ robe, and whenever you make your daily preparations, roll 1d6 and consult the\
  \ following list to determine the type of feathers. 1: crow; 2: duck; 3: ostrich;\
  \ 4: chicken; 5: goose; 6: peacock. With each step taken, huge amounts of feathers\
  \ sprout forth from the robe with great force. The feathers make you concealed from\
  \ all other creatures, but also conceal all other creatures from you. Of course,\
  \ you cannot use this concealed condition to Hide. </p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left:\

  \     <p><b>Abjuration, Invested, Chaotic</b><br> <b>Price</b> An indeterminate\

  \ Worn armor; <b>Bulk</b> 4</p> \n     <p>This classic, timeless suit of <em>+1\
  \ resilient full plate</em> is personally assembled from modular pieces of flat-packed\
  \ darkwood, doubling as furniture and personal protective gear. To wear or remove\
  \ the <em>suit of armoire</em>, you must succeed at a DC 41 Crafting check (yes,\
  \ this includes the +10 modifier for an “Incredibly Difficult” challenge); on a\
  \ failure, you and all creatures within 30 feet must succeed at a DC 31 Will save\
  \ or be overcome with frustration at how you can’t follow the simple, easy-to-understand\
  \ diagrams for assembling the armoire, imposing a –1 status penalty to Will saves\
  \ for 1 hour.</p> \n     <p><b>Activate</b> [one-action] Interact; <frequency>\n\
  \        Once per day; \n       <requirements>\n         You did not fail at the\
  \ check to assemble the \n        <em>suit of armoire</em> today; \n        <b>Effect</b>\

  \         You \n        <em>did</em> fail the check to assemble the \n        <em>suit\
  \ of armoire</em> at least once today; \n        <b>Effect</b> You forgot a peg\
  \ or bolt when you were assembling the \n        <em>suit of armoire</em>, causing\
  \ it to collapse to pieces around you, though this shields you from harm. The triggering\
  \ attack is a failure, or you succeed at your Reflex save. The \n        <em>suit\
  \ of armoire</em> falls apart around you into its constituent panels, leaving you\
  \ unarmored. \n       </requirements>\n      </trigger></p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left:\

  \ –</p> \n     <p>This extremely fetching oversized compass has numerous extraneous\
  \ gears, levers, doodads, and buttons. It does not function as a compass. Instead,\
  \ it always points to the nearest <em>wayfinder</em>. An indentation in the middle\
  \ of the <em>wayfinderfinder</em> can hold a single <em>wayfinder</em>. A <em>wayfinder</em>\
  \ stored in this manner—and any <em>aeon stone</em> it may contain—provides no benefits,\
  \ but the <em>wayfinderfinder</em> points to the nearest <em>wayfinder</em> of the\
  \ type stored within, instead of any <em>wayfinder</em>. If you have more than one\
  \ <em>wayfinderfinder</em> holding a <em>wayfinder</em> on your person at a given\
  \ time, the <em>wayfinderfinders</em> point to each other instead, and any <em>aeon\
  \ stones</em> in your possession begin annoyingly bouncing off your head instead\
  \ of rotating around it.</p> \n     <p><b>Activate</b> [one-action] command; <b>Effect</b>\
  \ The <em>wayfinderfinder</em> shouts “Explore! Report! Cooperate!” then rapidly\
  \ explains that certain uses of the <em>wayfinderfinder</em> may void its warranty.</p>\
