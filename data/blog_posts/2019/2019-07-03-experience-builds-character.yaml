  description\">Making a character in Pathfinder Second Edition is a process that\
  \ most experienced gamers will find familiar, but wherever possible, we made changes\
  \ to make the process more intuitive while still giving you a mountain of choices\
  \ and flexibility. It all starts with imagining the character you want to play.\
  \ Maybe you want to be a ferocious dwarven warrior who takes on the aspects of an\
  \ animal in the heat of battle. Maybe you want to play a wise-cracking elven con\
  \ artist who grew up on the streets, but now plays at being a member of high society.\
  \ Or maybe you just want to make a mysterious wizard that loves to blow things up.\
  \ Pathfinder gives you all the tools to make these characters and countless more!\
  \ Even if you don't have a complete concept in mind, the steps of character creation\
  \ in Pathfinder are there to help you make the big decisions and focus in on a character\
  \ that you are excited to play.</p>\n              <h2>Learning your ABCs</h2>\n\
  \              <p>With a concept in mind (no matter how fully formed), the next\
  \ step is to make the major decisions about your character. We call these decisions\
  \ your ABCs because you need to decide on your character's Ancestry, Background,\
  \ and Class. By making these big choices, along with any additional decisions that\
  \ come with each, the character you want to play will take shape!</p>\n        \
  \      <p>Think of these choices as deciding the major moments in your character's\
  \ youth. First off you were born, the details of which are decided by your Ancestry.\
  \ Next up is your youth, which is molded by your Background. Finally, your Class\
  \ decides the life you have chosen to live as an adventurer. Along each step of\
  \ the way, you will make additional decisions that reinforce and shape the image\
  \ of your character. Chief among these are your ability scores. Each step of your\
  \ ABCs impacts your ability scores, giving boosts and flaws to these six vital stats,\
  \ changing your raw potential to accomplish tasks and overcome danger.</p>\n   \
  \           <h2>Details and Polish</h2>\n              <p>Throughout the character\
  \ creation process, you must record a variety of details about your character. Many\
  \ of these are simple proficiency upgrades, noting your character's aptitude at\
  \ performing specific tasks or resisting effects. Others require you to select from\
  \ a list of options, like your ancestry's heritage or a feat from your class. Every\
  \ single choice you make influences what you can accomplish during play, making\
  \ you different from the others around you. Even if some of the big choices are\
  \ the same, these smaller decisions can make two clerics, for example, play entirely\
  \ differently. One might be a virtuous warrior priest, fighting for her deity with\
  \ blade and shield, while the other is a pious adherent, using spells and sermons\
  \ to preach a peaceful path.</p>\n              <p>Once all of the choices have\
  \ been made, it's time to buy your starting gear and begin filling out all of your\
  \ statistics. Starting heroes have precious few gold pieces to start with and buying\
  \ the right gear can mean the difference between a glorious career and a forgotten\
  \ grave.</p>\n              <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n               <a href=\"\

  >Iakhovas</span><br>\n                 To illustrate this process, I'll be building\
  \ a Second Edition version of one of my First Edition Pathfinder Society characters,\
  \ named Iakhovas.<br><br></span> <br style=\"clear: all;\"></p>\n              <h2>Step\
  \ 1: Create a Concept</h2>\n              <p>What sort of hero do you want to play?\
  \ The answer to this question might be as simple as \"a brave warrior,\" or as complicated\
  \ as \"the child of elven wanderers, but raised in a city dominated by humans and\
  \ devoted to Sarenrae, goddess of the sun.\" Consider your character's personality,\
  \ sketch out a few details about their past, and think about how and why they adventure.\
  \ Many character concepts center around the character's class, their ancestry, or\
  \ both, so it might be a good idea to flip through the available ancestries and\
  \ classes to help inspire you. The Core Rulebook includes a helpful spread with\
  \ a quick summary of each.</p>\n              <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n    \

  ></a>\n              </div>\n              <p>Your character's concept might also\
  \ center around their background, personal identity, deity, relationship to the\
  \ other characters, or anything else you can imagine!</p>\n              <p><span\

  \ Sans Bold','Helvetica','Arial',sans-serif;font-weight:normal;font-size:18px; font-size:1.5rem;line-height:2rem\"\
  >Iakhovas: Concept</span><br>\n                 My concept for Iakhovas was a defense-focused\
  \ master of all martial techniques, skilled and willing to protect and train others,\
  \ shaped by the death of his sister and his revenge against the vampire Talia Nightcrescent,\
  \ whose staking makes him a wanted murderer in the undead-dominated nation of Geb.\
  \ This concept means Iakhovas is a Garundi human, probably either a fighter or a\
  \ monk. </span> <br style=\"clear: all;\"></p>\n              <br>\n           \
  \   <h2>Step 2: Start Building Ability Scores</h2>\n              <p>Start all ability\
  \ scores at 10 in preparation for the later steps. This is a good time to start\
  \ thinking about what ability scores will be important for your character. You can\
  \ even jot down your ability scores as you adjust them on your character sheet.</p>\n\
  \              <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n               <a href=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190702-cs1.jpg\"\

  \ step.</p>\n              <p><span style=\"border-top: 1px solid #fff; position:\

  \ font-size:1.5rem;line-height:2rem\">Iakhovas: Ability Scores</span><br>\n    \
  \             I start all of Iakhovas's ability scores at 10. Thinking about the\
  \ way I see him fighting, I think he's likely to fight with a combination of strength\
  \ and grace in order to be a master of all martial techniques, so I'm likely to\
  \ prioritize Dexterity and Strength. I see him as being wise and fit as well, so\
  \ if I get a chance, I might want to raise Constitution or Wisdom.</span> <br style=\"\
  clear: all;\"></p>\n              <br>\n              <h2>Step 3: Select an Ancestry</h2>\n\
  \              <p>Select an ancestry for your character. Ancestry determines your\
  \ character's size, Speed, and languages, and contributes to their Hit Points. Each\
  \ also grants ability boosts and ability flaws to represent the ancestry's basic\
  \ capabilities.</p>\n              <p>You'll make four decisions when you select\
  \ your character's ancestry:</p>\n              <ul>\n               <li>Pick the\
  \ ancestry itself.</li>\n               <li>Assign any free ability boosts and decide\
  \ if you are taking any voluntary flaws.</li>\n               <li>Select a heritage\
  \ from those available within that ancestry, further defining the traits your character\
  \ was born with.</li>\n               <li>Choose an ancestry feat, representing\
  \ an ability your hero learned at an early age.</li>\n              </ul>\n    \
  \          <p></p>\n              <p><span style=\"border-top: 1px solid #fff; position:\

  \ font-size:1.5rem;line-height:2rem\">Iakhovas: Ancestry</span><br>\n          \
  \       Since I selected human for Iakhovas's ancestry, he is Medium size, has a\
  \ 25-foot Speed, speaks Common and Osiriani to start, and begins with 8 Hit Points\
  \ from his ancestry. <br><br>\n                 Both of his ability boosts are free,\
  \ so I assign them to Strength and Dexterity, the two I decided were most important\
  \ to him in Step 2. This brings him to 12 Strength and Dexterity. I don't see Iakhovas\
  \ as being particularly unintelligent or uncharismatic, and I said I wanted to try\
  \ to raise the other four ability scores, so I won't be taking any voluntary flaws.<br><br><img\
  \ src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190702-skilledheritage.jpg\"\
  \ align=\"left\" style=\"padding-right: 10px;\" alt=\"Skilled Heritage: Your ingenuity\
  \ allows you to train in a wide variety of skills. You become trained in one skill\
  \ of your choice. At 5th level, you become an expert in the chosen skill.\">For\
  \ Iakhovas's heritage, I have some great options. Mechanically, the half-elf and\
  \ half-orc heritages bring a lot to the table, with better vision and access to\
  \ some excellent new feats, but conceptually, I pictured Iakhovas as a standard\
  \ human. I eventually choose the skilled heritage, since that will help me fulfill\
  \ my concept of being skilled a little better, even if I can't invest as much in\
  \ Intelligence. Since I want him to be a master of all martial techniques, I choose\
  \ Athletics as his trained skill from his heritage.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190702-naturalambition.jpg\"\
  \ align=\"left\" style=\"padding-right: 10px;\" alt=\"Natural Ambition, Feat 1.\
  \ Human. You were raised to be ambitious and always reach for the stars, leading\
  \ you to progress quickly in your chosen field. You gain a 1st-level class feat\
  \ for your class. You must meet the prerequisites, but you can select the feat later\
  \ in the character creation process in order to determine which prerequisites you\
  \ meet.\">Finally, I choose an ancestry feat. Haughty Obstinancy has a nice benefit\
  \ against vampiric domination, but it doesn't really fit his personality. Natural\
  \ Skill would give him yet more skills, and Cooperative Nature would grant him an\
  \ incredible +4 circumstance bonus to Aiding his allies, both of which fit his concept,\
  \ but eventually I decide to take Natural Ambition, which will grant him another\
  \ class feat and help him be a master of all martial techniques. I can wait and\
  \ choose the class feat later on, as Natural Ambition mentions.<br><br></span></p>\n\
  \              <br>\n              <h2>Step 4: Pick a Background</h2>\n        \
  \      <p>Your character's background might represent their upbringing, an aptitude\
  \ they've been honing since their youth, or another aspect of their life before\
  \ they became an adventurer. They typically provide two ability boosts (one that\
  \ can be applied to either of two specific ability scores, and one that is free),\

  \ font-size:1.5rem;line-height:2rem\">Iakhovas: Background</span><br>\n        \
  \         Iakhovas's background is one of the parts of him that is most difficult\
  \ to quantify here. He and his sister were used for their blood by a vampire—the\
  \ sister of a Blood Lord of Geb—until the vampire overfed and killed his sister,\
  \ breaking him free of his domination and leading him to stake the vampire while\
  \ she slept. Then wanted for murder, he escaped Geb and joined the Pathfinders,\
  \ trading his loyalty for the promise of asylum. He is certainly a criminal in Geb,\
  \ and criminal is a background, but he hasn't really lived the life of a criminal,\
  \ so the mechanical elements wouldn't make much sense. Laborer is normally a good\
  \ choice for characters enslaved by evil creatures, but that background is about\
  \ a life of manual labor, and Iakhovas was kept around for his blood. My other options\
  \ are acolyte, acrobat, animal whisperer, artisan, artist, barkeep, barrister, bounty\
  \ hunter, charlatan, detective, emissary, entertainer, farmhand, field medic, fortune\
  \ teller, gambler, gladiator, guard, herbalist, hermit, hunter, martial disciple,\
  \ merchant, miner, noble, nomad, prisoner, sailor, scholar, scout, street urchin,\
  \ tinker, or warrior. <br><br>\n                 If I was using Lost Omens World\
  \ Guide, I would have the absolutely perfect background, \"Quick.\"<br><img src=\"\
  https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190702-quick.jpg\" alt=\"Quick. Background.\
  \ Staying alive among the scheming, ravenous undead of Geb required a deep knowledge\
  \ of their motivations, capabilities, and weaknesses. More often than not, it also\
  \ required the ability to weave alibis and life-preserving half-truths capable of\
  \ swaying a stilled heart. Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Charisma or\
  \ Constitution, and one is a free ability boost. You're trained in the Deception\
  \ skill and the Undead Lore skill. You gain the Charming Liar skill feat.\"><br><br>\n\
  \                 As is, I still have a good choice with the core: I can focus not\
  \ on who he was in Geb but who he has become, and choose martial disciple, so that's\
  \ what I do.<br><img src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190702-martialdisciple.jpg\"\
  \ alt=\"Martial Disciple. Background. You dedicated yourself to intense training\
  \ and rigorous study to become a great warrior. The school you attended might have\
  \ been a traditionalist monastery, an elite military academy, or the local branch\
  \ of a prestigious mercenary organization. Choose two ability boosts. One must be\
  \ to Strength or Dexterity, and one is a free ability boost. You're trained in your\
  \ choice of the Acrobatics or Athletics skill. You gain a skill feat: Cat Fall if\
  \ you chose Acrobatics or Quick Jump if you chose Athletics. You're also trained\
  \ in the Warfare Lore skill.\"><br><br>\n                 For my ability score,\
  \ I can't go wrong since it has my two favorite options! I take Strength and Dexterity\
  \ both (They are both now 14). I'm already trained in Athletics from my heritage,\
  \ so I choose Acrobatics for my skill, gaining the Cat Fall skill feat. Then I gain\
  \ Warfare Lore automatically. <br><img src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190702-catfall.jpg\"\
  \ alt=\"Cat Fall. Feat 1. General. Skill. Prerequisites: trained in Acrobatics.\

  \ 10 feet shorter. If you're an expert in Acrobatics, treat falls as 25 feet shorter.\
  \ If you're a master in Acrobatics, treat them as 50 feet shorter. If you're legendary\

  \              <br>\n              <h2>Step 5: Choose a Class</h2>\n           \
  \   <p>At this point, you need to decide your character's class. A class gives your\
  \ character access to a suite of heroic abilities, determines how effectively they\
  \ fight, and governs how easily they can shake off or avoid certain harmful effects.\
  \ You don't need to write down all of your character's class features yet. You simply\
  \ need to know which class you want to play, which determines the ability scores\
  \ that will be most important for your character.</p>\n              <p><span style=\"\

  \ knew I was going to build him as either a monk or a fighter, and now that I've\
  \ followed him down this journey, I'm thinking monk! It's okay, I'll take the fighter\
  \ archetype later to really mix up his martial techniques. At this point I'm just\
  \ recording my key ability score from monk. I get to pick Strength or Dexterity\
  \ again—my two favorites—but this time I'm forced to choose between them. After\
  \ a little internal debate, I decide on Strength, so Strength is now 16.</span></p>\n\
  \              <br>\n              <h2>Step 6: Determine Ability Scores</h2>\n \
  \             <p>Now that you've made the main mechanical choices about your character,\
  \ it's time to finalize their ability scores. Do these three things:</p>\n     \
  \         <ul>\n               <li>First, make sure you've applied all the ability\
  \ boosts and ability flaws you've noted in previous steps (from your ancestry, background,\
  \ and class).</li>\n               <li>Then, apply four more ability boosts to your\
  \ character's ability scores, choosing a different ability score for each and increasing\
  \ that ability score by 2.</li>\n               <li>Finally, record your starting\
  \ ability scores and ability modifiers.</li>\n              </ul> Remember that\
  \ each ability boost adds 2 to the base score of 10, and each ability flaw subtracts\
  \ 2. You should have no ability score lower than 8 or higher than 18. \n       \
  \       <p></p>\n              <p><span style=\"border-top: 1px solid #fff; position:\

  \             After applying the previous steps, I have Strength 16, Dexterity 14,\
  \ and all the rest 10. For my four additional boosts, I'll choose to boost Strength\
  \ and Dexterity again, and then Wisdom and Constitution, which I had been looking\
  \ for a way to boost but hadn't until now. This leaves me with Strength 18, Dexterity\
  \ 16, Constitution 12, Intelligence 10, Wisdom 12, Charisma 10.</span></p>\n   \
  \           <br>\n              <h2>Step 7: Record Class Details</h2>\n        \
  \      <p>Now, record all the benefits and class features that your character receives\
  \ from the class you've chosen. While you've already noted your key ability score,\
  \ you'll want to be sure to record the following class features.</p>\n         \
  \     <ul>\n               <li>To determine your character's total starting Hit\
  \ Points, add together the number of Hit Points your character gains from their\
  \ ancestry and the number of Hit Points they gain from their class.</li>\n     \
  \          <li>The Initial Proficiencies section of your class entry indicates your\
  \ character's starting proficiency ranks in a number of areas. Choose which skills\
  \ your character is trained in and record those, along with the ones set by your\
  \ class. If your class would make you trained in a skill you're already trained\
  \ in (typically due to your background), you can select another skill to become\
  \ trained in.</li>\n               <li>See the class advancement table in your class\
  \ entry to learn the class features your character gains at 1st level—but remember,\
  \ you already chose an ancestry and background. Some class features require you\
  \ to make additional choices, such as selecting spells.</li>\n              </ul>\n\

  >Iakhovas: Class Details</span><br>\n                 With 8 Hit Points from his\
  \ human ancestry, 10 from the monk class, and 1 from Constitution, Iakhovas ends\
  \ with a very respectable 19 HP. His initial proficiencies tell me he is trained\
  \ in Perception, has expert proficiency in all three saving throws, is trained in\
  \ simple weapons and unarmed attacks, is untrained in all armor but has expert proficiency\
  \ in unarmored defense, and has trained proficiency in monk class DC. He's also\
  \ trained in a number of skills equal to 4 plus his Intelligence modifier, so four.\
  \ Since he already has Acrobatics and Athletics, I decide his other skills are Medicine\
  \ since he would have needed to perform to bandage up and handle lost blood, Stealth\
  \ for sneaking around and escaping the notice of the undead, Religion to represent\
  \ his new faith in Pharasma (goddess of death) and his knowledge of undead weaknesses,\
  \ and Diplomacy to cover the way he likes to instruct new recruits—in a friendly\
  \ fashion rather than like a drill sergeant.<br><br>\n                 The advancement\
  \ table shows me he also gets powerful fist, the incredibly potent Flurry of Blows\
  \ action, and a monk feat of my choice! <br><img src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190702-powerfulfist.jpg\"\
  \ alt=\"Powerful Fist. You know how to wield your fists as deadly weapons. The damage\
  \ die for your fist changes to 1d6 instead of 1d4. Most people take a –2 circumstance\
  \ penalty when making a lethal attack with nonlethal unarmed attacks, because they\
  \ find it hard to use their fists with deadly force. You don't take this penalty\
  \ when making a lethal attack with your fist or any other unarmed attacks.\"><br><br><img\

  \ has the flourish trait, you can use Flurry of Blows only once per turn.\"><br><br>\n\
  \                 Now it's time to choose my monk feat. And I get two feats, thanks\
  \ to Natural Ambition. As a master of all martial techniques, I definitely want\
  \ Iakhovas to have a stance. Looking through the options, there are a lot of very\
  \ good choices. Dragon Stance and Wolf Stance are both strong using the stats I\
  \ have right now, but Mountain Stance is tempting, even if it would mean I'd need\
  \ to go back and rearrange some earlier choices to deprioritize Dexterity.<br><img\

  Dragon Stance [one-action]. Feat 1. Monk. Stance.  Requirements: You are unarmored.\

  \ They are in the brawling group and have the backswing, nonlethal, and unarmed\

  \ terrain while Striding.\"><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190702-mountainstance.jpg\"\
  \ alt=\"Mountain Stance [one-action]. Feat 1. Monk. Stance.  Requirements: You are\
  \ unarmored and touching the ground. You enter the stance of an implacable mountain—\
  a technique first discovered by dwarven monks—allowing you to strike with the weight\
  \ of an avalanche. The only Strikes you can make are falling stone unarmed attacks.\
  \ These deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage; are in the brawling group; and have the forceful,\
  \ nonlethal, and unarmed traits.\r\nWhile in Mountain Stance, you gain a +4 status\
  \ bonus to AC and a +2 circumstance bonus to any defenses against being Shoved or\
  \ Tripped. However, you have a Dexterity modifier cap to your AC of +0, meaning\
  \ you don't add your Dexterity to your AC, and your Speeds are all reduced by 5\
  \ feet.\"><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20190702-wolfstance.jpg\"\
  \ alt=\"Wolf Stance [one-action]. Feat 1. Monk. Stance.  Requirements: You are unarmored.\
  \ You enter the stance of a wolf, low to the ground with your hands held like fanged\
  \ teeth. You can make wolf jaw unarmed attacks. These deal 1d8 piercing damage;\
  \ are in the brawling group; and have the agile, backstabber, finesse, nonlethal,\
  \ and unarmed traits.\r\nIf you’re flanking a target while in Wolf Stance, your\

  \ how much damage they deal in combat, and their armor influences their Armor Class;\

  \ after an early youth lost to vampiric domination. I decide to go with 28. His\
  \ gender is male and he uses he/him pronouns. His class DC, as we saw before, is\
  \ trained, and it's based on his Strength, so it would be 17 (10 + 4 from Strength\
  \ + 1 from level + 2 for being trained). He generally would start a session with\
  \ 1 Hero Point. His AC would be a solid 18 (10 + 3 from Dexterity + 1 from level\
  \ + 4 from being an expert). Finally, he is carrying 5 Bulk and 3 light (4 Bulk\
  \ 2 light from the monk kit, 1 more Bulk entirely of javelins, and then 1 light\
  \ for holy water). He can carry way more than this, so he can probably help other\
