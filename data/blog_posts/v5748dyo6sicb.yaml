  \ \n      <p>Il’setsya Wyrmtouched began as my arcanist PC in <em>Rise of the Runelords</em>,\
  \ where she gave me an in-character outlet to express my inner self every week through\
  \ a CN, wildly unfiltered, fun by any means character. She was and remains a whole\
  \ lot of -GOALS- with a bucket of common PC characteristics of mine taken to a delightful\
  \ extreme: after magically transitioning via a protean artifact, the Lethe Wall\
  \ of Galisemni, she’s magically skilled and silly, with high intelligence, low wisdom,\
  \ a fifteen-foot-long tail, happily married to her half-faerie dragon wife. Seriously,\
  \ what’s not to love? I first wrote about her and her Wyrmtouched siblings in <em>Planar\
  \ Adventures</em> and later, when I serendipitously needed a protean-linked NPC\
  \ in my volume of <em>Agents of Edgewatch</em>, “Ruins of the Radiant Siege,” she\
  \ was right there, practically begging for the job. Of course, a whimsical hedonist\
  \ who’s a literal agent of manifest chaos isn’t going to work with every party,\
  \ but she’s a fun challenge, and in that role, she was my attempt to make as close\
  \ to a patron saint of Chaotic Neutral transwomen as I could.</p> \n      <div class=\"\

  \ of my proudest achievements in my freelancing career!</p> \n      <p>Tesyovensku\
  \ is a nonbinary fetchling I wrote up for <em>Lost Omens: The Grand Bazaar</em>.\
  \ You may have even had the chance to encounter them in a certain Pathfinder Society\
  \ scenario! Getting to create a character whole-cloth who shares my gender identity\
  \ was a thrilling experience, and I'm so glad they've resonated with so many people\
  \ out there.</p> \n      <p>Tesyovensku's story is also one about triumph over adversity,\
  \ something that I think many of us are struggling to achieve these days. The future\
  \ for the queer community seems bleak, and honestly, if my little contributions\
  \ to Paizo's canon can provide a glimmer of hope, then I am deeply honored and touched\
  \ to have made things a little bit better. Together, we can all pull through—and\

  \ (he/him) is a human trans man from Cheliax who fled religious persecution as a\
  \ child with his family before settling in Absalom. He used his art skills to help\
  \ support his family and save for a <em>serum of sex shift</em>, and he grew up\
  \ to be a successful tattoo artist in Absalom’s Docks District. His boyfriend is\
  \ an azarketi dockworker named Brine, and the two of them can be found in Arhan’\

  \ their extraordinary resourcefulness and willingness to try anything, they cured\
  \ themself—though they’re still not quite sure which cure they attempted did the\
  \ trick. Upon realizing they were cured, Mios gave up the life of a driver and decided\
  \ to try their hand at adventuring, knowing that all monsters have weaknesses, if\
  \ only you can find them. You can read more about Mios at <a href=\"https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6si2a?Meet-the-Iconics-Mios\"\

  \ I created for Lost Omens: Grand Bazaar and put a lot of myself into. Her story\
  \ has all my favorite tropes—fey blessings, ill-fated bargains, and the power of\
  \ names. While Iltara was far from the first trans woman in Pathfinder, she was\
  \ the first NPC whose shop offers gender-affirming transmutations to patrons! If\

  \ – <em>Senior Developer</em></h3> \n      <p><b>Tregellon Pearlcask (he/him)</b><br>\
  \ The sky citadel of Highhelm has many mouths to feed, and local dwarves of the\
  \ Pearlcask clan have developed sophisticated aquaculture that supplies the city\
  \ with a wide variety of shellfish. In&nbsp;<em>Pathfinder Adventure Path #193:\
  \ Mantle of Gold</em>, something sinister has sneaked into Tregellon Pearlcask’\
  s caves, afflicting his prize crab (whose art we can’t wait to show you). His being\
  \ a trans man isn’t crucial to the adventure; it’s just who he is, and he openly\
  \ affirms it with Pearlcask humor. He’s described as&nbsp;“dressed for working on\
  \ the water, wearing little beyond sturdy trousers, a teal sash around his waist,\
  \ and several pearl studs in his ears. He’s muscular, with a horizontal scar under\
  \ each pectoral (\"Molting scars,” he acknowledges with a knowing wink, if asked).\"\
  </p> \n      <br> \n      <h3>Michael Bramnik (he/him)</h3> \n      <p>Hello there!\
  \ To quote a friend, I might be, “straight enough to calibrate a Kinsey scale,”\
  \ but I long for the day when months like these are no longer needed except purely\
  \ in celebration. I fervently believe that LGBTQ+ visibility and positive representation\
  \ are vitally important if we are ever going to move on to a better future.</p>\
  \ \n      <p>For <em>Pathfinder Society #4-05: The Arclord Who Never Was</em> &lt;spoiler&gt;\
  \ the character of Alyreha (who is encountered with a different name at first) is\
  \ trans. I made this decision because of her study into the magic of True Names.\
  \ Having been honored to escort friends to their procedures in the past and seeing\
  \ just how much more “them” they were afterwards—it just felt&nbsp;<em>right&nbsp;</em>for\
  \ the story of someone finding herself. &lt;/spoiler&gt; It can be a blink-and-you’\
  ll-miss-it moment (but is more pronounced in Isis Wozniakowska’s <em>#4-10: Arclord’\
  s Abode</em>) because I think that normalization might be the most important aspect\
  \ of representation, or, to use a movie quote from my childhood that taught me this\
  \ lesson quite early, “peoples is peoples”—a lesson I hope future allies will learn.\
  \ For this and all months to follow, I wish you all the best.</p> \n      <div class=\"\

  \ \n      <p>While I haven’t had the joy of writing any published trans characters\
  \ (yet), I have seen myself in so many Paizo books- it’s one of the reasons I love\
  \ the games we make and am so happy to be a part of this company! Above all, Arhan\
  \ Benimaya(he/him) from <em>Lost Omens: Grand Bazaar</em> spoke to me very strongly\
  \ as a Jewish trans man. Seeing someone who looks like me and whose story echoes\
  \ with my heart made me even more certain that Golarion was a place for me.</p>\
  \ \n      <br> \n      <h3>Shay Snow (they/them) – <em>Pathfinder Society Developer</em></h3>\
  \ \n      <p>Kyyduh is the Starfinder iconic evolutionist, which I worked on and\
  \ helped create with the Starfinder team earlier this year. If you ask Kyyduh about\
  \ their gender, their answer will be \"Gender? don't even know 'er!\" The agender\
  \ pahtra uses they/them pronouns, no matter what form or shape they adapt while\
  \ being an evolutionist. They identify as bisexual, with no true preference to gender,\
  \ and they’ve identified as agender since they were a tiny kit shedding their first\
  \ canines. They have ADHD and struggle to focus on verbal instructions, but when\
  \ given written instructions they can adapt and pick up almost any skill presented\
  \ to them.</p> \n      <p>Creating Kyyduh was a special experience for me, and allowed\
  \ me to explore agender expression through a character that I knew would be public-facing.\
  \ I was a little nervous when the blogs went live, unsure of how the Paizo community\
  \ might feel about a nonbinary iconic, however I was genuinely overjoyed when I\
  \ saw so many cheerful and welcoming comments, validating Kyyduh’s identity and\
  \ disability. Kyyduh’s a bright, cheerful pahtra and will be facing so many upcoming\
  \ adventures in the Starfinder universe!</p> \n      <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ He is a little ode to drag performers.</p> \n      <p>Domakayo is a performer\
  \ living on Vault of Vorlath. He performs in bars and has a dedicated fanbase. Domakayo\
  \ dresses in his well known glitter bodysuit and discoball tail extension, and paints\
  \ his scales in vibrant colors to mimic and exaggerate the colorations of female\
  \ Vesk. His dance performances are lively and are punctuated by crushing items,\
  \ a play on old fashioned Vesk courtship dances.</p> \n      <p>Domakayo loves expressing\
  \ himself through his dance performances and the transformation he goes through\
  \ before getting on stage. He has no stage name, finding comfort in using his own\
  \ name and being who he was not allowed to be back home.</p> \n      <p>Rhenei Aldori\
  \ (they/them) from <em>The Swordlord's Challenge</em> &nbsp;always felt pressured\
  \ by the demands of Ysoki society. Ysoki have a relatively short lifespan, and in\
  \ Rhenei’s family there was a big emphasis on settling down while young and having\
  \ kids. Classic gender roles never seemed to fit. Mom. Dad. Nanny. Caretaker. Babysitter.\
  \ Even if not pressed into a parental role, their family would still press them\
  \ into a caregiver role. When Rhenei clearly stated they did not wish any of this,\
  \ there was a huge fallout. Rhenei left their home, and eventually ended up studying\
  \ Aldori swordlord. After training, Rhenei swore the swordpact and is now Rhenei\
