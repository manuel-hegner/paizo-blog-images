  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">Tuesday, April 5, 2016</p> \n    <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"\
  > \n     <p>First, I would like to emit a gentle squeeing noise, then inform you\
  \ that many Class Deck characters are soon to exist as <a href=\"/products/btpy9l30\"\
  >Pathfinder Pawns</a>! (If you're looking for pawns for the iconics, you'll find\
  \ the Rise of the Runelords iconics in the <a href=\"/products/btpy8x1f\"><em>NPC\
  \ Codex Box</em></a> and the ones from Skull &amp; Shackles and Wrath of the Righteous\
  \ in the <a href=\"/products/btpy99sc\"><em>Inner Sea Pawn Box</em></a>, which also\
  \ includes pawns for many of the characters in the upcoming Goblin decks!)</p> \n\
  \     <p itemprop=\"description\">Since we've already had someone make the case\
  \ for Damiel as the <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lhjt\">best character ever</a>,\
  \ we're skipping right to the <a href=\"/products/btpy9fqi\"><em>Alchemist Class\
  \ Deck</em></a> preview this week. This deck is the brainchild of Lone Shark designers\
  \ Liz Spain and Paul Peterson (and if you know them, you are now probably a little\
  \ afraid and a lot excited). Let's get to it.</p> \n     <h2>Damiel 2: Alchemical\
  \ Boogaloo</h2> \n     <p>Everyone's favorite potion-maker made his Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Card Game debut in the <a href=\"/products/btpy92zj\"><em>Skull &amp; Shackles\
  \ Base Set</em></a>, wherein he flexed his Craft skill and threw as many Noxious\
  \ Bombs as he could get his hands on. He was also fond of that set's Fire Lance,\
  \ a tasty little firearm that featured the Alchemical trait. We've brought back\
  \ the Fire Lance, and given it a big brother.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  ></a>\n      <br> <i>There was supposed to be an earth-shattering KABOOM!</i>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>As you can see, this Damiel's skipped the Craft checks for\
  \ alchemical goodies and spell work and gone straight to automatic recharge, Valeros-style.\
  \ He can also throw alchemy bombs as kickers to his Ranged attacks. Roles for this\
  \ new Damiel are called Miscibility Master (because we respect the classics) and\
  \ Mindchemist (because Liz is just a little insane).</p> \n     <h2>The New Class:\
  \ Cogsnap and Mother Myrtle</h2> \n     <p>The other two characters in this deck\
  \ are the definitely unstable Cogsnap and the grounded, nurturing Mother Myrtle.\
  \ Cogsnap has some of my favorite character art in the whole game; you can tell\
  \ just by looking at him what sort of character he is. He blows up monsters then\
  \ harvests them for parts. My favorite role for this fellow is the Bloodbomber,\
  \ whose flavor text reads, \"To bloodbombers, all liquids can be turned into explosives,\
  \ including what remains after the explosion.\" <i>[Mike: My work here is done.]</i>\
  \ Maniacal cackling is basically a requirement if you want to play Cogsnap.</p>\

  ></a>\n      <br> <i>Heheheheheheheheheh... boom.</i>\n     </div> \n     <p>Mother\
  \ Myrtle, by contrast, is a sweet old lady. A jaunty sprig of holly rides atop her\
  \ hat. She carries bundles of grain and a bowl of something nourishing. I'm sure\
  \ she only uses that scythe to harvest herbs. And her roles are Preservationist\
  \ and... Reanimator?</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6813-MotherMyrtle.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n      <br> <i>I bet the witch in Hansel and Gretel looked friendly too.</i>\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>Myrtle is a spellcaster who's very thrifty. She likes to\
  \ keep things cycling, and she knows a little about a lot. I find her to be a very\
  \ well-rounded character to play; I hope you like her.</p> \n     <h2>Where's the\
  \ Candy?</h2> \n     <p>To close, I thought I'd share with you some of the cool\
  \ new boons we've put in this deck, including some sneak previews of a whole bunch\
  \ of Mummy's Mask cards that we just couldn't wait to put into print. This deck\
  \ is all about the Alchemical trait and elemental damage types, so I've got a shield\
  \ that's useful if you accidentally blow yourself up, some silver-tongue elixir,\
  \ and possibly my favorite ally art yet.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n\
