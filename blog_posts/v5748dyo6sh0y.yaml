  >Lost Omens World Guide</a> and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01zt4?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Character-Guide\"\
  >Lost Omens Character Guide</a> now being out for a while and with previews and\
  \ reviews of all kinds floating around the web, I wanted to delve a little further\
  \ behind the scenes to the authors who actually wrote the material contained within.\
  \ While the writers of our Paizo products are always credited in the front and back\
  \ of the books, a simple name in a byline doesn’t give readers much information\
  \ on the people who work to bring the setting to life! As a final blog to wrap up\
  \ our promotion of the first two Lost Omens Guides, I reached out to the authors\
  \ of the two books with the intent of promoting them—as well as any other personal\
  \ work they would like to promote, so that new fans of their work could find other\
  \ projects, RPG products, websites, livestreams, and more to enjoy!</p> \n     <p\

  \    <p>I’m James Jacobs, and I wrote about Runelords and Linnorm Kings and Winter\
  \ Witches and other Saga-worthy Stuff in this book. A certain amount of what lives\
  \ today in Golarion first came to be in my homebrew setting, which I’ve been working\
  \ on since the 80s… but today, Golarion is so much more than that! I’d like to take\
  \ this chance to thank everyone else who has helped build up Golarion over the years,\
  \ be they any of the amazing writers I feel so honored to be counted among in this\
  \ book, but also every other writer out there who’s contributed to Golarion lore.\
  \ And ESPECIALLY thanks to Eleanor and Luis, who hit the ground running with the\
  \ daunting task of developing and organizing the Lost Omen line of books—Golarion\
  \ couldn’t be in better hands!</p> \n     <h3>Lyz Liddell</h3> \n     <p>I'm Lyz,\
  \ a game editor-turned-designer who had the privilege of updating the Shining Kingdoms\
  \ for the World Guide. Working on this section was a fun opportunity to decide how\
  \ some of the oldest nations of our campaign setting have fared given the epic events\
  \ occurring around and within them—some for the better, and some for the worse!\
  \ While rolling dice and writing new ways to roll them is my day job and a big chunk\
  \ of my free time, my degrees are actually in music performance and am a passionate\
  \ professional performer of medieval, renaissance, and baroque music. I specialize\
  \ in recorders, other wind instruments, and viola da gamba, though I’m always finding\
  \ and learning how to play new old instruments. You can check out my writing and\
  \ musical work at <a href=\"http://www.LyzLiddell.com\" target=\"new\">LyzLiddell.com</a>,\

  \ Lundeen</h3> \n     <p>I’m Ron Lundeen, and I’ve been a developer here at Paizo\
  \ for nearly two years. Adventures are the thing I love most; when I’m not developing\
  \ adventure path volumes during the day, I’m often writing adventures for Pathfinder,\
  \ Starfinder, or other systems at night. But every good adventure needs a gripping\
  \ setting, and I was thrilled to contribute to the Lost Omens World Guide. I’d just\
  \ finished developing the Tyrant’s Grasp Adventure Path at the time, so I knew quite\
  \ a lot about the Gravelands (the nation formerly known as Lastwall) and the Whispering\
  \ Tyrant. Because I’d contributed to the Ironfang Invasion Adventure Path as an\
  \ author and freelance developer, I also knew quite a bit about Nirmathas and the\
  \ new hobgoblin nation (which I got to name!). The Eye of Dread is a rough region,\
  \ and I was very excited to lay it out for everyone for our new edition! You can\
  \ check out my RPG advice, including a free Pathfinder Second Edition adventure\
  \ path I’m writing, on my blog at <a href=\"http://RunAmokGames.com/\" target=\"\
  new\">RunAmokGames.com</a>.</p> \n     <h3>Erik Mona</h3> \n     <p>Over the last\
  \ decade, I’ve been accumulating a 90,000-word continuity document on everything\
  \ we’ve ever published about the city of Absalom. From the names of minor streetsweepers\
  \ mentioned in a Pathfinder Society scenario to details on the many times the city\
  \ has come under siege, it’s all gone in there to make sure we don’t mess anything\
  \ up when we inevitably make room in the schedule for a <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq021bz?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Absalom-City-of-Lost-Omens\"\
  >big Absalom book</a>. With that enormous research project in hand, I snagged the\
  \ Absalom and Starstone Isle section of this book, and used it as an opportunity\
  \ to flesh out the rest of the Isle of Kortos. Given the island’s huge size, I knew\
  \ that it must contain more than just a couple of other towns and a big mountain,\
  \ and the Lost Omens World Guide gave me the opportunity to set that stuff down\
  \ for the first time. We’ll be fleshing out Kortos in the upcoming <a href=\"https://paizo.com/store/pathfinder/adventures/adventurePath/extinctioncurse\"\
  >Extinction Curse</a> Adventure Path, and I couldn’t be more excited! I’ve also\
  \ long had my creative marker on the Impossible Lands, which I invented way back\
  \ for the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btpy82t7?Pathfinder-Chronicles-Gazetteer\"\
  >Pathfinder Chronicles Gazetteer</a>, which offered me a chance to add more flesh\
  \ to one of Golarion’s most mysterious and exciting regions! What a joy to get to\
  \ watch the campaign setting develop from a badly drawn map and a few pages of notes\
  \ that started way back in 2006!</p> \n     <h3>Mark Seifter</h3> \n     <p>I'm\
  \ Mark Seifter, game designer and one of the four leads on the creation of Pathfinder\
  \ Second Edition. Check out my twitch stream with Linda Zayas-Palmer, Arcane Mark,\
  \ Tuesdays and Thursdays at 7PM Pacific, and Saturdays at 10 AM Pacific at <a href=\"\

  \ We cover a variety of RPG and Pathfinder topics on Tuesdays and Saturdays, chosen\
  \ by the viewers, with interviews on Thursdays!</p> \n     <h3>James Sutter</h3>\
  \ \n     <p>I’m James L. Sutter, former Paizo Executive Editor, developer, and Starfinder\
  \ Creative Director. Since that first gazetteer of Varisia in <i>Pathfinder Adventure\
  \ Path #3</i>, I’ve spent more than a dozen years writing about Golarion, and been\
  \ honored to work alongside some of the most creative people in the business as\
  \ we watched a handful of proper nouns and graph-paper maps transform into the living\
  \ world it is today. So when the folks at Paizo offered to let me help usher the\
  \ setting into a new edition, I leapt at the chance to revisit my first fantasy\
  \ home. (The fact that they let me play with some of my favorite toys didn’t hurt,\
  \ either. I’ll forever be a champion of godless Rahadoum, which led me to write\
  \ my first novel, <i>Death’s Heretic</i>. And how could I resist Hermea, with everyone’\
  s favorite problematic dragon lord...) These days you can find me on Twitter at\

  \ classes in writing and worldbuilding, in which I share what I've learned from\
  \ my time on Pathfinder and Starfinder.</p> \n     <br> \n     <img src=\"https://cdn.paizo.com/image/content/Blog/20191126-charguide_500.jpeg\"\

  >John Compton</h3> \n     <p>I’m John Compton, recently organized play lead developer\
  \ and now Starfinder senior developer. When I started working at Paizo about 7 years\
  \ ago, I quickly became the local gnome enthusiast, and it’s been a delight to carry\
  \ that passion into Second Edition by writing about our gnomes and our expanded\
  \ understanding of how they absorb and ultimately bleed magic based on the four\
  \ magical traditions. As we explored non-human ethnicities, these seemed a fun way\
  \ to show how the eclectic gnomes’ features vary less by ancestry and more by local\
  \ eldritch phenomena.</p> \n     <p>If you’d like to hear more from me, I frequent\
  \ Twitter (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/Archaeotagh\" target=\"new\">@Archaeotagh</a>)\
  \ and several Pathfinder, Starfinder, and Organized Play servers on Discord. Definitely\

  \ Harving</h3> \n     <p>Hi all, my name is Sasha Laranoa Harving, but I've been\
  \ credited as Sasha Hall and Sasha Lindley Hall in the past. I wrote the dwarf section\
  \ of Lost Omens Character Guide, and I'm really happy with what I got done! I tend\
  \ to write for a number of 3rd Party publishers, and some of my proudest accomplishments\
  \ are the Successor Base Class from Lost Spheres Publishing (<a href=\"https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/259539/Classes-of-the-Lost-Spheres-Successor\"\
  \ target=\"new\">found here</a>), and the Mythos Mystic Connection from Everybody\

  \     <h3>Mike Kimmel</h3> \n     <p>Hey folks! I'm Mike Kimmel, and I've been writing\
  \ for Paizo since 2014. The Organized Play program holds a special place in my heart,\
  \ so it was an honor to write about the Pathfinder Society in the <em>Lost Omens\
  \ Character Guide</em>. Writing new mechanics for a system-in-progress was a challenging\
  \ and rewarding experience that deepened my appreciation for Pathfinder's new edition.\
  \ I am grateful to be able to contribute to the games that have played such an important\
  \ role in my life. Another way I show thanks to the community is by running Freelance\
  \ Forge, a forum for RPG freelancers. You can learn more at <a href=\"https://freelanceforge.boards.net/\"\

  \ target=\"new\">https://twitter.com/_MikeKimmel</a>.</p> \n     <h3>Ron Lundeen</h3>\
  \ \n     <p>I’m Ron Lundeen, a developer on the Pathfinder adventure path line here\
  \ at Paizo. I’m also a big fan of little halflings. When we talked internally about\
  \ establishing ethnicities for non-human ancestries, I came to the meeting with\
  \ about a dozen handouts and two pages of notes on othobans and mihrinis and other\
  \ ethnicities I’d invented. So I had a lot to say during that meeting, and I jumped\
  \ at the chance to write the halfling section of this book. I love that the little\
  \ flourishes I wrote—like hallinettes and bill-bands and slang terms—all made it\
  \ in. But halflings weren’t all I wrote about! I’d recently described the new hobgoblin\
  \ nation of Oprak in the <em>Lost Omens World Guide</em> and was eager to create\
  \ the new hobgoblin ancestry. This was a bit of a struggle, because the hobgoblins\
  \ presented in the <em>Bestiary</em> aren’t too smart, but the hobgoblin focus on\
  \ military strategy and alchemy in our world led me to insist they had to get an\
  \ Intelligence bonus. I’m glad that carried the day! You can check out my RPG advice,\
  \ including a free Pathfinder Second Edition adventure path I’m writing, on my blog\
  \ at <a href=\"http://RunAmokGames.com/\" target=\"new\">RunAmokGames.com</a>.</p>\
  \ \n     <h3>Matt Morris</h3> \n     <p>In 2015, encouraged by an amazing group\
  \ of creative friends, I made a showing in RPG Superstar, and that experience pushed\
  \ me to explore writing for 3rd-party companies. I’ve been lucky enough to work\
  \ extensively with <a href=\"http://everybodygames.net/\" target=\"new\">Everybody\
  \ Games</a> and <a href=\"https://www.roguegeniusgames.com/\" target=\"new\">Rogue\
  \ Genius Games</a>, producing a variety of rules options for Pathfinder and the\
  \ popular <a href=\"http://everybodygames.net/starfarers-companion\" target=\"new\"\
  >Starfarer’s Companion</a> for Starfinder.</p>\n     <p> Recently, I’ve enjoyed\
  \ working with a talented group of collaborators at Paizo, beginning with my contributions\
  \ to the <em>Starfinder Armory</em> and <em>Alien Archive 2</em>. My work on Pathfinder\
  \ Player Companions has had me <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01vb0?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Martial-Arts-Handbook\"\
  \ target=\"new\">body slamming</a>, <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01w1y?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Wilderness-Origins\"\
  \ target=\"new\">bushwacking</a>, and <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01yji?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Chronicle-of-Legends\"\
  \ target=\"new\">relic hunting</a> my way through Golarion, and writing back matter\
  \ for an Adventure Path has even taken me to the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws3?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-139-The-Dead-Roads\"\
  >Boneyard</a>! The Lost Omens line for Pathfinder Second Edition has given me the\
  \ opportunity to explore some of my favorite parts of the setting, and I can’t wait\
  \ for everyone to see what is in store from the line in the future! For the <em>Lost\
  \ Omens Character Guide</em>, I wrote the Firebrands, Hellknights, Knights of Lastwall,\
  \ and Magaambya Adepts in the NPC Gallery. </p>\n     <p> I keep an up-to-date list\
  \ of my work on my Paizo profile, and I’m always looking for interesting projects,\
  \ so feel free to send me a message via the forums if you are looking for a reliable\
  \ writer!</p>\n     <p> When not writing, I’m teaching high school English near\
  \ Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. </p> \n     <h3>Patchen Mortimer</h3> \n     <p>I'm\
  \ an ad agency copywriter and DJ from Baltimore. (Those ads where the kids ran the\
  \ gummi bear factory—I wrote those!) But most people know me from <em>The Daily\
  \ Bestiary</em> (<a href=\"https://dailybestiary.tumblr.com\" target=\"new\">dailybestiary.tumblr.com</a>\
  \ and <a href=\"https://dailybestiary.blogspot.com\" target=\"new\">dailybestiary.blogspot.com</a>),\
  \ where I spent 7+ years writing adventure seeds for nearly every monster in the\
  \ Pathfinder <em>Bestiaries</em>. For Paizo, I typically write articles for <em>Pathfinder\
  \ Adventure Path</em>—mostly ecologies, adventure seeds, and gazetteers for GMs.\
  \ Shining a light on some overlooked corner of the game is pretty much my favorite\
  \ thing to do, so working on the “Lizardfolk” and” Other Ancestries” sections of\
  \ the <em>Lost Omens Character Guide</em> was a fantastic chance to do that for\
  \ players, too! I hope all your iruxi PCs hit level 20. </p>\n     <p> Please find\

  \ If you're a publisher interested in a system-neutral fantasy project (or an artist\

  \ Park. </p> \n     <h3>Andrew Mullen</h3> \n     <p>Howdy! I wrote about the Magaambya—\
  my favorite Golarion organization! —and figured I’d share my thinking process for\
  \ the venerable institution’s 2e debut. Three bits of information were my ‘pillars’\
  \ when I was considering Magaambyan history and organizational structure: they’\
  re about 8,000 years old; they’re capital-g Good; and no attacker has ever gotten\
  \ within 20 miles of Nantambu.</p>\n     <p> What sort of organization lasts that\
  \ long with that little (successful) aggression toward it? One with allies! Especially\
  \ with the established Magaambyan focus on spreading knowledge, it made sense to\
  \ me that the Magaambya had stuck around so long because they had good working relationships\
  \ with their geographic neighbors. That idea lead to the five branches’ community-oriented\
  \ duties and purviews, the contemporary Magaambya’s interest in helping groups outside\
  \ of the Mwangi Expanse (plus the recent and intriguing ‘big magic’ events in Avistan),\
  \ as well as the Perquisite, the traditional service period associated with entry\
  \ into the organization.</p>\n     <p> That said, I think a cooperative Magaambya\
  \ still leaves room for adventure-driving conflict and tension. Magaambyans can\
  \ fly off to help those in need, sure, but there’s also the frustrations of a large\
  \ organization trying to build consensus and affect greater change. That can spin\
  \ off into all kinds of stories!</p> \n     <h3>Mikhail Rekun</h3> \n     <p>При\
  ветствую, уважаемые читатели! My name is Mikhail Sergeyevich Rekun, and I am a Paizo\
  \ freelancer who has previously worked on The Half-Dead (AP #139) and several Companions,\
  \ with much more to come. Outside of gaming, I’m a Russian-American historian and\
  \ educator, with a doctoral degree from Northeastern University, presently employed\
  \ at Times College Nanjing. My research focus is late Imperial Russian foreign policy,\
  \ and I’ve published a book on the subject, <a href=\"https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781498559638/How-Russia-Lost-Bulgaria-1878–\
  1886-Empire-Unguided\" target=\"new\">How Russia Lost Bulgaria, 1878-1886: Empire\
  \ Unguided</a> (Lexington Books, 2018). </p>\n     <p> My academic background means\
  \ that when I write for games, I spend a lot of time thinking about the interplay\
  \ of societies and individuals, what in historiography is called the concept of\
  \ historical agency. How are choices constrained by upbringing, how can one person\
  \ change a culture? In the <em>Lost Omen Character Guide</em>, where I wrote the\
  \ human ethnicities, this meant asking what it meant to grow up Vudrani, or how\
  \ a Taldan background can influence someone. Hopefully, the results did not disappoint.</p>\n\
  \     <p> Forthcoming publications include a large part of Absalom, City of Lost\
  \ Omens, a few sections in the Advanced Player Guide, and two AP backmatter articles.\

  \ K.C. Stephens, and this is one of my first Pathfinder 2nd Ed credits! I was a\
  \ tad surprised when I was told I was an author for this book, since the work I\
  \ did was originally slated for another project. But, that’s one of the important\
  \ things developers like Eleanor Ferron and Luis Loza do. They look at the needs\
  \ of multiple projects, and put work where it does the most good and makes the most\
  \ sense.</p>\n     <p> Since leaving my position as Paizo’s Starfinder Design Lead,\
  \ I’ve taken a position as developer for Green Ronin’s Fantasy AGE rpg, and been\
  \ focusing on my blog (<a href=\"http://owenkcstephens.com\" target=\"new\">owenkcstephens.com</a>),\
  \ and producing game material and rpg writer and developer advice supported by my\
  \ Patreon (<a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/OwenKCStephens\" target=\"new\">https://www.patreon.com/OwenKCStephens</a>).\

  \ Thorne (though I previously wrote as Isabelle Lee), and I’ve been a contributor\
  \ for a few years now. I’ve written for all the Pathfinder and Starfinder lines\
  \ except Starfinder Society. While my work often centers on mechanical content,\
  \ I enjoy writing flavor content when I can; as a trans girl, I prioritize LGBTQ+\
  \ inclusivity in my work.</p>\n     <p> For the <em>Lost Omens Character Guide</em>,\
  \ I wrote some elements for the elf section (most notably the ancient elf heritage\
  \ and the Vourinoi ethnicity) and the Knights of Lastwall section. Being able to\
