  > \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">Hi everyone! I'm just getting ready to tell\
  \ you all about <a href=\"/products/btpy9bs3\"><em>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game:\
  \ Demon's Heresy Adventure Deck</em></a>, but I want to make sure I have everything\
  \ I need.</p> \n     <p>Copy of the adventure deck to refer to as I write? Check.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Supply of snacks? Check.</p> \n     <p>Mike locked in a closet so he\
  \ can't interrupt me as I tell everyone about Adventure Deck 3? CHECK!</p> \n  \
  \   <p class=\"tiny\">Mike: <i>MRRPH!</i> BANG! BANG!</p> \n     <p>MUHUHAHAHAHAHAHA!\
  \ ALL RIGHT! The biggest surprise in all of <a href=\"/pathdinder/adventureCardGame/wrathOfTheRighteous\"\
  ><em>Wrath of the Righteous</em></a> set for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game\
  \ is right here in <a href=\"/products/btpy9bs3\">Adventure Deck 3</a>. It's going\
  \ to BLOW YOUR MIND! You won't BELIEVE it!</p> \n     <h2>Let's Get It Started</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>But first, let's talk about the adventure. <em>Demon's Heresy</em> takes\
  \ place after the players have liberated the city of Drezen. This gives them a safe\
  \ haven in the middle of the Worldwound from which to strike out against the demons.\
  \ There is so much to be done that the players can pick and choose the order they\
  \ attempt most of the scenarios before tackling the Ivory Sanctum at the end.</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6023-DemonsHeresyFront.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6023-DemonsHeresyFront_180.jpeg\"\

  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6023-DemonsHeresyBack_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n      <br> <i>What is this Heresy?</i> \n     </div> \n     <p>If you're\
  \ smart, you'll tackle the Demon's Redoubt first. (I'll get more into why later\
  \ on.) It's a cheeky little scenario where the demon Arueshalae is trapped in a\
  \ ruined castle. In each deck, there's an extra monster in the form of a Grimslake.\
  \ And it should be easy to find, since it's right on top. Not too much to worry\
  \ about. You just have to make a check or bury some cards from your deck. And if\
  \ you fail, you can bury another card for good measure.</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  ></a>\n      <br> <i>You shall doubt it a second time!</i> \n     </div> \n    \
  \ <p>It's not all bad, though. After you close two of the locations, you get to\
  \ add another one to the mix, with no henchmen or villains in it. Why would you\
  \ want to do that? KEEP READING!</p> \n     <p>In the end, you must track down the\
  \ hag Jaruunicka. She's pretty nasty. She requires a check to play attack spells,\
  \ she can force you to discard blessings as damage, and she has the second-highest\
  \ check to defeat of any villain in this deck. Plus, she has an odd little trick\
  \ if you fail your check: you have to draw as many cards as you're dealt in damage\
  \ and then recharge the same number. There's a small chance this will immediately\
  \ kill you, but if it doesn't, you might get a better selection of cards.</p> \n\
  \     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6023-Jaruunicka.jpg\"\

  ></a>\n      <br> <i>What a hag!</i> \n     </div> \n     <h2>The Demon's Dangers</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>This deck has some truly impressive monsters. Take the Dominion Scientists,\
  \ for example. They are masters of learning your weaknesses. They deal 2 Force damage\
  \ to you, and if you take it, they get tougher. Plus they are resistant to magic,\
  \ which really tends to annoy the casters in the party.</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  ></a>\n      <br> <i>To-o-o-o-oad Science! Ooh!</i> \n     </div> \n     <p>My favorite,\
  \ though, is the Toad Demon. Its check to defeat is 28! That's at least 5 higher\
  \ than any other monster in the deck, which makes sense, as you can reduce it by\
  \ 5 if you don't go after it with a melee attack. Still, a very high check, and\
  \ if you fail, it will ribbit all over everyone at your location.</p> \n     <p>There\
  \ are four new Temptations in this deck, each with its own risk and reward. Take\
  \ a gander at the Glimmer of Hope. Every turn, you can take a chance to stall the\
  \ blessing deck. All you have to do is look at a random card from your deck. You\
  \ can choose to bury it and the deck will advance normally, or you can banish it,\
  \ which will prevent the blessing deck from advancing. Who needs all those cohorts,\
  \ anyway?</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6023-GlimmerOfHope.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6023-GlimmerOfHope_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n      <br> <i>Hope springs eternal.</i> \n     </div> \n     <h2>Good Stuff!</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>As frightening as these dangers are, there are equally great rewards.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>For the spells, there's Steal Soul. Play this spell after a character\
  \ at your location defeats a monster that isn't immune to the Attack trait, and\
  \ you'll gain a d4 on ALL of your checks for the rest of the scenario. It's hard\
  \ to think of a bigger advantage than that for casting a single spell.</p> \n  \
  \   <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6023-StealSoul.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6023-StealSoul_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n      <br> <i>They weren't using it anyway.</i> \n     </div> \n     <p>The\
  \ Unfettered Imp is one of the best allies we've ever created. It lets you acquire\
  \ Corrupted blessings for FREE if they are on top of the blessings discard pile\
  \ during your check. A Corrupted blessing is risky, and you have to play it immediately,\
  \ but you get to keep it afterward.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n   \
  \   <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6023-UnfetteredImp.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6023-UnfetteredImp_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n      <br> <i>Much better than the fettered imp.</i> \n     </div> \n   \
  \  <p>And let us not forget the Tome of Mental Prowess. I'm amazed this card got\
  \ printed. It's an item that lets you gain a FEAT. Yes, we've done cards that give\
  \ you feats before. But this is the first time we've made one that is usable more\
  \ than once. It does require a Knowledge 30 check to keep it from being removed\
  \ from the game, but this is the mythic set. Twenty-sided dice are the characters'\
  \ bread and butter.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6023-TomeOfMentalProwess.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6023-TomeOfMentalProwess_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n      <br> <i>Reuse or recycle.</i> \n     </div> \n     <h2>OH MY GOD!</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>All of that is very cool. Really! But let's get down to it. No one is\
  \ going to stop me this time.</p> \n     <p class=\"tiny\">Mike: <i>MRRRO! MRRRO!\
  \ MRRROOOOO!</i></p> \n     <p>As I said above, after the players close two locations\
  \ in The Demon's Redoubt, they get to build the Tower of the Fourth Sphere. It's\
  \ sort of an optional location to explore, as there's no villain or henchmen in\
  \ it. But if you put in the time and effort to close the location, and you win the\
  \ scenario, there is an amazing reward.</p> \n     <p>YOU GET TO PLAY ARUESHALAE!</p>\
  \ \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6023-Arueshalae.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6023-Arueshalae_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a> <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6023-ArueshalaeBack.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6023-ArueshalaeBack_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n      <br> <i>She's a WHAT?!</i> \n     </div> \n     <p>For the first time,\
  \ we've added a new character to the game <i>after</i> the base set. Any one player\
  \ can choose to switch to playing her after you win this scenario, or a new player\
  \ can jump right in and join your party. You will get the same number of feats as\
  \ any other character, right there on the spot. Leave no character behind, I say.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>And she's a SUCCUBUS! We're letting you play a DEMON! But it's okay.\
  \ She's a good demon... for a demon. She delved a little too deeply into the idea\
  \ of a soul, and Desna gave her one. Well, part of one, anyway. Now she must fight\
  \ to become redeemed or risk falling back into her old ways.</p> \n     <p>There\
  \ are a number of advantages to choosing to switch to Arueshalae. In addition to\
  \ resistance to three types of damage and the ability to evade any encounter she\
  \ doesn't like, she has a special cohort called Arueshalae's Gift that she can give\
  \ to another character. He gets a bonus to all checks in one skill for as long as\
  \ he has it. But what a demon gives, a demon can reclaim: Arueshalae can take her\
  \ gift back (or not) on her turn to give it to another character or change which\
  \ skill it affects.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n      <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6023-ArueshalaesGift.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6023-ArueshalaesGift_180.jpeg\"\

  ></a>\n      <br> <i>Arueshalae giveth… and so does Desna.</i> \n     </div> \n\
  \     <p>There's another subtle benefit to being Arueshalae. The loot cards the\
  \ players get at the end of this scenario all have the trait \"Owner: Arueshalae,\"\
  \ which means that she can fill out her deck with them if the party comes up short\
  \ of cards of the same type at the end of a scenario. (She may want to help make\
  \ sure that happens if she banishes one of them.)</p> \n     <p>When the time comes\
  \ for a player to pick a role for the succubus, that player can either choose to\
  \ fully redeem her or have her fall again.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\
  >\n      <a href=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6023-ArueshalaeRedeemed.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6023-ArueshalaeRedeemed_180.jpeg\"\

  ><img src=\"//static1.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6023-ArueshalaeFallen_180.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n      <br> <i>Two sides of the same coin.</i> \n     </div> \n     <p>The\
  \ Redeemed role doubles down on the character's ability to help others. She can\
  \ gain the ability to get her Gift back at the start of ANY turn, which lets her\
  \ basically give a bonus to any one skill for each other character on their turn.\
  \ She can also heal and peek at her location deck.</p> \n     <p>The Fallen role\
  \ turns the corruption mechanic in this set on its head. You can use Corrupted cards\
  \ to heal yourself, but more importantly, you can ignore the Corrupted trait on\
  \ any card so all of those penalties that others have to deal with just don't affect\
  \ you. You can also gain the full benefits of the Corrupted blessings, even if the\
  \ top card of the blessing discard pile isn't also Corrupted. Oh, and she's a succubus,\
  \ so if anybody doesn't acquire an ally, she will.</p> \n     <p>Whew. It feels\
  \ so good to get that off of my chest. I've been trying to tell you about her for\
  \ so long now. She's so amazing, and now you can finally play with her!</p> \n \
  \    <p>Hey. Wait. I just realized there's nothing stopping me from telling you\
  \ about the secrets for the next adventure deck, too!</p> \n     <p>In Adventure\
  \ Deck 4 we have...</p> \n     <p class=\"tiny\">CRASH!</p> \n     <p class=\"tiny\"\
