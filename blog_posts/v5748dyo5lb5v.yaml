  \ </h1> \n   <p class=\"date\"> Friday, June 25, 2010 </p> \n   <p>Next month I\
  \ travel to Europe for a Pathfinder Society whistle-stop tour of several exciting\
  \ events. I start with an event in Copenhagen on July 9, head down to Wiesbaden,\
  \ Germany for an Ulisses-Spiele event on July 11, swing over to Utrecht and Leiden\
  \ in the Netherlands for a pair of back-to-back events on July 13, skip down to\
  \ the south of France in beautiful Lyon for a Black Book Editions event on July\
  \ 15, and then make my way north to Birmingham for a weekend of Paizo Con UK events\
  \ from July 17 through July 18. Then, just when it's getting started, I wing my\
  \ way back to Paizo on July 19.</p> \n   <p>Quite a trip—one that I'm very excited\
  \ to embark on—but before I get down to the details of each stop, I'll give a little\
  \ background on why Paizo is sending me through the European Union and the UK to\
  \ participate in Society events. </p> \n   <p>When the Society first started, we\
  \ knew we eventually wanted to build a dedicated network of volunteer coordinators—\
  we call them Regional Coordinators. These folks would be our go-to men and women\
  \ who could help organized local conventions, game days, and hobby store events\
  \ as well as function as our core of volunteers at Paizo Con, Gen Con, Dragon Con,\
  \ Paizo Con UK, Games Expo UK, Gen Con Australia... well, you get the idea. We are\
  \ now ready to make a big deal about our coordinator system (watch for a blog post\
  \ here next week), but before we can really get started I need to know where our\
  \ largest communities in Europe are, and who among them are the most dedicated.\
  \ I already had a good idea of who and where these folks were in the US, Australia,\
  \ and Canada, but I had only a vague notion of our hardest-core European groups.\
  \ Thus a trip was ordered, and now I head for Europe next month to participate in\
  \ local events and talk to their organizers about possibly becoming a regional coordinator\
  \ for their city or country. </p> \n   <p>Here are the details: </p> \n   <p><b>Copenhagen,\

  \ free of charge. The station across the center covers all the other needs (bakery,\

  \ and the team of the tutoring center for giving us the permission to use their\
  \ facilities. Across from the tutoring center there is the department store called\
  \ \"Lilien-Care\" with a parking deck where you can park your car for a fee of only\
  \ EUR 3.00 for the whole day. Around the center there are several more parking areas\
  \ too but we recommend that you use the parking deck. You can find free parking\
  \ lots behind the Wiesbaden main station in the direction of the Schlachthof and\
