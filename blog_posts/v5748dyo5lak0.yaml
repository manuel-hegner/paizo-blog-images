  \ Part 2</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Friday, October 2, 2009</p> \n   <p>One of\
  \ the big highlights of Gen Con Australia 2009 was the \"What’s Next for Pathfinder?\"\
  \ seminar that took place Saturday afternoon. The Pathfinder players at the show\
  \ were so excited for this seminar that they took a break from their Pathfinder\
  \ Society games to attend. Not surprisingly, it was pretty packed.</p> \n   <p>Although\
  \ much of what was covered during this seminar had already been announced, there\
  \ were a few surprises in store, including the final two new base classes being\
  \ planned for the <i>Advanced Player’s Guide</i> and a special surprise, a first\
  \ look at one of the base classes from that book. At Gen Con Indy this year, we\
  \ announced four of the six base classes slated to appear in the <i>Advanced Player’\
  s Guide</i>: the alchemist, the cavalier, the oracle, and the summoner. During this\
  \ seminar, the final two were revealed: the inquisitor and the witch.</p> \n   <p>The\
  \ inquisitor class is going to look a lot like your Van Helsing-type character,\
  \ dedicated to hunting down and killing monsters. This means that the class is going\
  \ to have a fair number of skills and some limited divine spellcasting ability.\
  \ In addition, the inquisitor is going to have the ability to designate a foe during\
  \ combat, and the longer the combat progresses, the more damage he will deal to\
  \ that foe in combat. Unlike a ranger, the inquisitor’s abilities are not based\
  \ on monster type. Instead he has to carefully study his targets, learning how to\
  \ more effectively deal with them as a combat progresses. Higher-level inquisitors\
  \ will learn how to exploit monster weaknesses and possibly even add additional\
  \ weaknesses to a monster using special attacks.</p> \n   <p>The witch class is\
  \ going to be a class that fully embraces both the arcane and divine spell lists,\
  \ taking select spells from each to make for one intriguing list. The big news for\
  \ the witch is the focus on her familiar. This will function like a wizard’s familiar,\
  \ but with additional powers and abilities, with maybe a few extra limitations thrown\
  \ in to balance out the rules. You can also expect some new mechanics for witch\
  \ curses, through some new spells and class features.</p> \n   <p>While the crowd\
  \ was certainly excited to hear about these new classes, the room grew rather quiet\
  \ as I handed out a sample oracle character for them to analyze. But rather than\
  \ leave you out in the cold, here is that character, updated with the most recent\
  \ version of the class.</p> \n   <p><b>Sample Oracle</b><br> This sample shows one\
  \ of the first builds of the new oracle class. The relevant class abilities are\
  \ summarized, but they do not include additional bonuses that Areanna would gain\
  \ at higher levels. For example, at 9th level, Areanna’s form of flames ability\
  \ improves, allowing her to assume the form of a Medium fire elemental.</p> \n \

  \ cloak of resistance +1, ring of protection +1</i><br> <b>Special Abilities</b><br>\
  \ <b>Cinder Dance (Ex)</b>: Areanna’s base speed increases by 10 feet. At 5th level,\
  \ she receives Nimble Moves as a bonus feat.<br> <b>Fire Breath (Su)</b>: As a standard\
  \ action, Areanna can unleash a 15-foot cone of flame from her mouth. This flame\
  \ deals 1d4 points of fire damage per level, maximum 10d4. A Reflex save halves\
  \ this damage. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 her oracle level + her Charisma\
  \ modifier. She can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per\
  \ day for every four oracle levels she possesses.<br> <b>Form of Flame (Su)</b>:\
  \ As a standard action, Areanna can assume the form of a Small fire elemental, as\
  \ <i>elemental body I</i>. She can use this ability once per day, but the duration\
  \ is 1 hour/level.<br> <b>Speak in Tongues</b>: In times of stress, Areanna speaks\
  \ in tongues. Whenever she is in combat, she can only speak and understand Ignan.\
  \ This does not interfere with spellcasting, but it does apply to spells that are\
  \ language dependent. She gains Ignan as a bonus language.</p>\n   </blockquote>\
  \ \n   <p>As you can see, oracles are spontaneous divine spellcasters, working in\
  \ a manner similar to sorcerers. Instead of bloodlines, each oracle has a focus\
  \ (fire in Areanna’s case). At 1st level, 3rd level, and every four levels thereafter,\
  \ oracles can select one revelation from their focus to learn. These revelations\
  \ grant them special powers and abilities, such as the ability to breathe fire,\
  \ turn into a fire elemental, or even call down a storm of fire (Areanna is not\
  \ quite high enough level for that one). In addition, oracles must select a curse\
  \ at 1st level. These curses are a mixed blessing, with each one limiting the oracle\
  \ in one way, while granting special bonuses in other areas. Areanna’s curse is\
  \ perhaps one of the easiest to deal with, which is why it grants one of the smallest\
  \ bonuses.</p> \n   <p>Well, that about wraps up my summary of Gen Con Australia\
  \ 2009. I want to thank Ian Houlihan, the convention director, for bringing me down\
  \ to the show, Mark Rogerson, the events manager, for showing me a great time in\
  \ Brisbane, and Peter Ball, the seminar manager, for setting up some great panels.\
  \ I am hoping to make this show a regular in my convention schedule. Maybe next\
  \ year, you will too.</p> \n   <p>Jason Bulmahn<br> Lead Designer</p> \n  </blockquote>\
