  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">by Gabrielle Harbowy</p> \n    <h2>Chapter Four: People\
  \ and Causes</h2> \n    <div itemprop=\"articleBody\"> \n     <p><span itemprop=\"\
  description\">The camp's last remaining healer had died two days before, infected\
  \ by some foul colony of demonic parasites. Learning further details prompted Zae\
  \ to add \"never pray barefooted\" to her list of life lessons.</span></p> \n  \
  \   <p>Leodar, the knight who had greeted Keren, led the way with confidence through\
  \ the broken landscape, while Carom and Saric, two young but weathered knights,\
  \ brought up the rear. Strange geysers dotted the ground, some swelling like pustulant\
  \ wounds, others rising and falling as if the land was a breathing beast. Above,\
  \ beyond churning black clouds, the sky glowed the sickly color of rust, giving\
  \ off just enough light for gnome eyes to see by. Under the cover of night, things\
  \ clacked and slithered and grunted, distracting Zae with hints of movement in her\
  \ peripheral vision. The others didn't seem to notice.</p> \n     <p>Leodar rode\
  \ unerringly toward an outcropping of stone—the crumbling ruins of an old smithy,\
  \ barely sturdy enough to serve as an outpost. A clash of swords rang out from beyond\
  \ the building, followed by a blaze of firelight.</p> \n     <p>Leodar lowered his\
  \ visor. \"Seems we're not too late.\"</p> \n     <p>Keren took a deep breath and\
  \ nudged her horse forward. \"Ennis! It's Keren. I've come from Lastwall.\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>A burst of fire bloomed above the smithy, leaving blinding afterimages\
  \ in Zae's vision. The knights charged toward the fray, and Zae nudged Appleslayer\
  \ to follow the horses. They rounded the structure in time to see a half-dozen cloaked\
  \ and hooded figures, all chanting in unison, surrounding a single knight in mismatched\
  \ armor. </p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n      <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500_Ennis_500.jpeg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500_Ennis_360.jpeg\" border=\"0\"\
  ></a>\n      <br>Ennis is devoted to his cause—even unto death.\n     </div> \n\
  \     <p>Ennis Rhinn might once have looked very much like his sister, before the\
  \ demonplague. Now he looked barely human—gaunt as a corpse, face mottled purple\
  \ and red with bruises and open sores, and just a few thready strands of greasy,\
  \ ash-dusted hair. </p> \n     <p>\"Ennis!\" Keren shouted again, and circled around\
  \ to charge one of her brother's attackers. </p> \n     <p>\"Begone, demon!\" he\
  \ shouted, hurling something as she passed. Keren deflected a jagged rock with her\
  \ shield. </p> \n     <p>\"Foul hallucination!\" he screamed. \"Do you lack the\
  \ stones to face me in your own form?\"</p> \n     <p>Keren cast a worried glance\
  \ back at her companions. Leodar lifted his shoulders, as if to say <i>This was\
  \ your idea</i>. Zae nudged Appleslayer forward to join her.</p> \n     <p>\"Ennis,\
  \ it's truly me. I'm here with Leodar, and others from your camp.\" She rode down\
  \ one of the sword-wielding cultists, then turned Eridem and charged another. \"\
  Ennis, by Iomedae, I swear to you...\"</p> \n     <p>A wordless scream interrupted\
  \ her—one of fury, not agony. \"I'll hear no more! I'll bash out my own brains before\
  \ I let you defile my goddess, or the memory of my sister! Go back to the Abyss,\
  \ demon!\"</p> \n     <p>Zae sighed. \"Well, at least he still cares about you.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>At a signal from Leodar, the other knights rode in, blades drawn.\
  \ They ignored Ennis's shouts of challenge and focused only on riding down his attackers.\
  \ All the cultists were armed with sickles and other blades, and there was something\
  \ about that which wasn't quite right.</p> \n     <p>\"Wait!\" Zae called. \"Weren't\
  \ there—\"</p> \n     <p>A burst of flame exploded in Carom's face, setting his\
  \ mount's mane ablaze. The horse panicked and reared, throwing its rider and trampling\
  \ him before bolting away into the night.</p> \n     <p>\"—sorcerers...\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>Ennis slashed with his longsword at anything within reach, armored knight\
  \ and robed cultist alike. Keren and Saric rode down cultist after cultist, beheading\
  \ them or hacking off limbs with long sweeps of their swords, while Leodar took\
  \ off after a sorcerer attempting to circle around and flank them. </p> \n     <p>Anticipating\
  \ Zae's command, Appleslayer bounded to where Carom had fallen from his horse and\
  \ lay unmoving on the ground. Zae tugged off one of his scorched gauntlets to reach\
  \ his skin and explore the extent of his injuries. </p> \n     <p>The broken ribs\
  \ were worse than the burns. Calling on Brigh, Zae pushed healing warmth through\
  \ her fingers and into him, steadying him, then fished into the satchel still slung\
  \ over her shoulder for a salve for the burns. Hail began to fall from the roiling\
  \ clouds, small crystals pelting Carom's armor like pebbles. Zae pulled up her hood\
  \ and ignored them, sheltering her patient with her small body while she repaired\
  \ the worst of his wounds. Appleslayer stood vigil over them both.</p> \n     <p>Presently,\
  \ Zae became aware that the annoying chanting had stopped. Instead, under the clash\
  \ of battle, she heard human voices. </p> \n     <p>\"Why do you aid me, demon?\"\
  \ </p> \n     <p>\"I'm not a demon, Ennis. I'm your sister.\"</p> \n     <p>Zae\
  \ stole a glance toward the siblings. Keren, Saric, and Ennis were on foot, parrying\
  \ and dodging a grotesque flying demon. It looked as if a giant, bloated snowball\
  \ of phlegm had consumed a few stray humans and a bat, with only wings and the odd\
  \ nest of misshapen limbs protruding from its mass. One of those limbs held a long,\
  \ barbed whip.</p> \n     <p>The cultists, and their chanting—they must have either\
  \ been summoning the demon, or protecting it.</p> \n     <p>\"Why'd you come?\"\
  \ Ennis asked. \"Did Father disown you, too?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Father's dead, Ennis.\
  \ I came to find you.\"</p> \n     <p>Saric swung upward at the demon's underbelly,\
  \ but it only flew up beyond his reach and lashed out with a flick of its slender\
  \ whip, capturing the crusader's arm. It turned with tug that knocked him to the\
  \ ground and sent his sword skittering away. Zae crept up toward him, praying under\
  \ her breath. </p> \n     <p>Keren hacked at one of the demon's wings while its\
  \ whip was entangled, but it rose out of range. Another of its arms was reaching\
  \ for something. At first Zae thought it was feeling for damage to its wing, but\
  \ instead it looked to be extracting a chunk of its own viscous flesh. As Saric\
  \ struggled to his feet, clutching the whip to keep the demon from pulling it free,\
  \ a burst of fire caught him in the chest. </p> \n     <p>There was the sorcerer\
  \ from before—the one Leodar had evidently not run down. Demonblooded, with wicked,\
  \ curved horns, and tiny motes of fire that hovered around her like moths. She flung\
  \ them toward the three knights with flicks of her wrist. Keren dodged the flame,\
  \ and charged at the spellcaster with a fierce battle cry.</p> \n     <p>Zae was\
  \ almost to Saric. His grasp on the whip only served as another tool for the demon,\
  \ which jerked away so sharply that the man's shoulder wrenched from its socket.\
  \ He lost his hold and slumped to the foul ground, where Zae was instantly at his\
  \ side. Before she could do more than lift Saric's visor, however, Ennis let out\
  \ a shout and dove toward her, knocking the gnome onto the prone man and falling\
  \ atop them both. </p> \n     <p>A thick, caustic rain splattered around them. Ennis\
  \ jerked against Zae's back and screamed, his breath rattling in his chest like\
  \ nails shaken in a cup. Face inches from the ground, Zae watched the acid carve\
  \ tiny pits in the rocky terrain. It was doing the same to Ennis's armor, and to\
  \ Saric—by Brigh's shiny eyeholes, she'd just exposed Saric's face moments before\
  \ the viscous attack. </p> \n     <p>Ennis tried to rise and failed, slumping back\
  \ heavily on top of them. From beneath him, Zae saw Keren approaching, silhouetted\
  \ against the night, longsword gleaming with the sorcerer's blood. She took a fierce\
  \ overhead swipe, splitting the demon's belly. A loud squelch—the sound of a stalk\
  \ of celery stabbing through an overripe tomato—heralded a second deluge. Zae ducked\
  \ her head, squeezing eyes and lips shut until it passed and all was silent. She\
  \ couldn't twist around far enough to reach Ennis's skin, or Saric's.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>\"Ennis...?\" she asked.</p> \n     <p>His weight on her didn't move, and\
  \ a wave of guilt and nausea flooded her. </p> \n     <p>Keren's voice answered\
  \ as Ennis's weight eased away. \"Careful what you touch.\"</p> \n     <p>Zae rose\
  \ unsteadily to her knees. The ground around them, everywhere that Ennis's body\
  \ hadn't shielded, was pocked and still quietly hissing. She was dry, as far as\
  \ she could tell, but Saric's helm was full of viscous acid. He had choked on it\
  \ even as it burned through his jaw and throat, and though she had been right there,\
  \ she hadn't been able to save him—either of them. Not the knight she'd been about\
  \ to heal, nor the one who, already plague-ridden, had sacrificed himself to shield\
  \ her... even without knowing what she meant to his sister.</p> \n     <p>They walked\
  \ gingerly, Keren carrying her brother's still hissing and popping corpse, to the\
  \ ruined smithy. There, Carom waited with two horses and Appleslayer. His breaths\
  \ were shallow, favoring his tender ribs, but he was whole. </p> \n     <p>Ennis\
  \ was not so lucky. Keren set him down with care, supporting his shoulder to keep\
  \ him from leaning his raw back against the stone, then realized that she needn't\
  \ bother. He was already gone. Keren set her face in a mask of calm to hold the\
  \ pain away until there was time for it. </p> \n     <p>It was a somber ride back\
  \ to the encampment, with Ennis's body draped across Keren's saddle. When they passed\
  \ the wardstone that marked the border and Zae pulled back her hood, white crystals\
  \ fell from the folds. On closer inspection, she saw that they were tiny teeth.</p>\
  \ \n     <p align=\"center\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n     <p>Keren traced her brother's medallion\
  \ with her fingertips, lost in thought. Zae came to sit on the tent's carpeted floor\
  \ beside her, and Apple padded over to rest his chin in her lap.</p> \n     <p>Keren\
  \ fished her necklace out of her tunic and set the medallions on the box, side by\
  \ side.</p> \n     <p>\"Is it killing you that I haven't opened it yet?\" It was\
  \ a pale attempt at teasing, but it heartened Zae that Keren was up to trying. </p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"You're apprehensive. I can't blame you. But the hardest part is over,\
  \ isn't it?\"</p> \n     <p>Keren pushed Ennis's medallion toward Zae. It was more\
  \ weathered than Keren's, but its intricacies were still intact. </p> \n     <p>\"\
  Together?\" Keren asked.</p> \n     <p>They each placed a disc to an impression\
  \ on the box. There was no sense of anything clicking into place, but the lid opened\
  \ smoothly at Keren's touch. </p> \n     <p>A parchment envelope nestled on cream-colored\
  \ velvet lining. Keren took it and examined both sides, but it was unmarked. She\
  \ took a deep breath and lifted the unsealed flap.</p> \n     <p>Zae could see that\
  \ the thick page bore neat lines of writing, but she couldn't make it out through\
  \ the back side of the paper. She rubbed Apple's head and waited, watching wetness\
  \ gather in Keren's eyes. </p> \n     <p>\"It's a peace offering. He accepts that\
  \ Ennis went his own way, and he's proud of both of us for fighting for what we\
  \ believe in. Here: ‘There are three of these rings, which I had forged. I will\
  \ wear mine into eternity, and the others are for you, to mark us as family. You\
  \ bear a piece of me, and my blessing, always. The people are more important than\
  \ the cause, Keren. Victory is meaningless without the people for whom we fight,\
  \ and the people we go home to.'\"</p> \n     <p>Keren caught her sleeve and swiped\
  \ her wrist across her eyes, then let out a trembling sigh and upended the envelope\
  \ into the box. \"He just wanted me and Ennis to be together again. And at the end,\
  \ I guess we were.\"</p> \n     <p>Two rings tumbled onto the velvet, gleaming and,\
  \ to Zae's eye, quite finely wrought of gold and platinum. Minutes ticked by, but\
  \ Keren didn't reach for them.</p> \n     <p>\"What will you do with them?\" Zae\
  \ asked. </p> \n     <p>Keren looked up. Stubbornly, she still refused to let her\
  \ tears fall. \"He wanted these to mark us as family, but I don't have any family\
  \ left—except you. Will you wear one?\"</p> \n     <p>Zae arched one thin blue eyebrow.\
  \ \"Are you sure he'd approve of that?\"</p> \n     <p>\"He'd want me to be happy,\
  \ and I'm happy with you. Your cooking is dangerous, and you perform dog surgery\
  \ in my house, and every moment with you is full of wonder and something new.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>Zae stood and wound her arms around Keren. \"I'd be honored,\" she\
  \ said. \"I wish I'd gotten to meet Ennis in health, or your father, or see more\
  \ of the Worldwound.\" </p> \n     <p>Keren laughed weakly. \"Sometimes I think\
  \ your curiosity is a death wish in disguise.\"</p> \n     <p>Zae touched her nose\
  \ to Keren's cheek. \"Oh, but it's not just curiosity. It's <i>informed</i> curiosity.\
  \ I know how big and complicated and dangerous the world is. What fascinates me\
  \ is all that variety—how the world can be so full of parts that are so complex\
  \ and weird and beautiful, and <i>interconnected</i>. I'm not fascinated by birds\
  \ in flight because I think flight is mystical and impossible, I'm fascinated because\
  \ I understand how it works, and how it works is fascinating. <i>That's</i> the\
  \ kind of wonder I see in the world. But to your second point?\" She grinned. \"\
  Yes. Probably.\"</p> \n     <p>Keren rolled her eyes. \"You'll need me to protect\
  \ you.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Definitely. And you'll need me to stitch you up after you\
  \ protect me. I hear some creatures think I'm a tasty snack. They might be relentless.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>\"<i>Are</i> you a tasty snack, pixie?\" There was a gleam in Keren's\
  \ eyes.</p> \n     <p>\"Are you relentless?\" Zae countered.</p> \n     <p>Though—\
  or perhaps because—Zae knew that both answers were yes, she was glad to have a long\
  \ voyage home in which to explore them fully.</p> \n     <p align=\"center\"><b>Coming\
