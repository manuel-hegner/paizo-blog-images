  \ class=\"PTales\"></div></a> \n   <h1>Misery's Mirror</h1> \n   <p>by Liane Merciel</p>\
  \ \n   <h2>Chapter Three: Silence</h2> \n   <p>\"What would spur someone to kill\
  \ her?\" Isiem wondered aloud as they left the dead shadowcaller on her bier. \"\
  Not rebellion, surely. In Westcrown, perhaps, but not Nisroch.\"</p> \n   <p>\"\
  The mirror,\" Ascaros answered. He swept up the stairs from the chamber of the dead\
  \ to their temporary quarters, where the Over-Diocesan's lackeys were to have delivered\
  \ Misanthe's belongings. Blue-flamed candles in sconces of bone flickered as he\
  \ went past. \"Of course it's the mirror. It could be nothing else.\"</p> \n   <p>Isiem\
  \ hurried after his friend. \"You don't even know what the mirror is.\"</p> \n \
  \  <p>\"True.\" Ascaros paused on the stairs, waiting until a black-robed Kuthite\
  \ acolyte passed out of earshot. \"But I know the Dusk Hall wants it badly enough\
  \ to send us all the way from Pangolais to fetch it. If they would do that, others\
  \ would do more.\"</p> \n   <p>They had reached the door to their room. It, too,\
  \ was built of bone, arranged in ornate patterns that drew the eye in and did not\
  \ easily let go. The same patterns repeated within the room, crawling over its walls\
  \ and ceiling. Black drapes muffled some of the walls, softening sounds that would\
  \ otherwise have reverberated harshly against the bones, but otherwise they were\
  \ surrounded by the leavings of the dead. Even the desk and chairs were built of\
  \ bone. The bedframe was an embrace of dead arms crowned with an arch of skulls.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>On that gray-blanketed bed, illumined by a flickering host of blue-flamed\
  \ tapers, Misanthe's belongings waited for them: A silver necklace holding a clear,\
  \ many-faceted stone within which ghostly snowflakes swirled. A staff of smooth,\
  \ glassy white wood that seemed almost ethereal in the cathedral's gloom.</p> \n\
  \   <p>And the mirror, hulking and ominous, its edge just peeping out from under\
  \ a shroud of night-blue silk. The mirror towered higher than either of the shadowcallers'\
  \ heads. A tangled hoop of chains served as its frame; the links of the chain had\
  \ been bent and battered until they resembled curved hooks gouging the air.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"It's an ugly piece of work,\" Ascaros said, pulling aside the silken\
  \ cover. The hooks caught the fine cloth and tore it; judging from the tatters that\
  \ fringed the shroud, that was not the first time the mirror had ripped its veil.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>A chill seemed to come over the room as the torn silk fell away, revealing\
  \ the milky, impenetrable grayness of the mirror's glass. Voices seemed to whisper\
  \ softly from its depths—not addressing the shadowcallers, but talking to each other\
  \ or themselves, unaware of those who listened from outside. Their accents were\
  \ archaic, their desire clear. One and all, they pleaded for freedom.</p> \n   <p>\"\
  It's not a nightglass,\" Isiem said. \"That's a midnight mirror. A prison.\"</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"Yes.\" Ascaros's face was unreadable. Isiem couldn't tell whether his\
  \ friend was relieved or dismayed that he recognized the midnight mirror for what\
  \ it was, but he was sure that Ascaros was not surprised. \"It's an heirloom of\
  \ my line.\"</p> \n   <p>\"You knew this was what the Dusk Hall wanted.\"</p> \n\
  \   <p>\"I suspected that it might be.\" Ascaros's grip tightened on his silver-capped\
  \ staff. His knuckles went white under the candles' blue glow. \"But I wasn't sure,\
  \ because if the lore of my family is true, it wouldn't do them any good. It only\
  \ functions for my kin.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Explain.\"</p> \n   <p>\"That mirror has\
  \ been passed down from father to daughter, aunt to nephew, through the generations\
  \ of my family since time immemorial. It goes to the magically gifted scions of\
  \ the line... to sorcerers, always and only.\" Ascaros gazed into the mirror as\
  \ if he could read his own future—or his ancestors' past—within the rippling fog.\
  \ \"Misanthe was the last of those, except for myself. She told me that much of\
  \ its history, but not what it does or why we keep it. All she ever said was that\
  \ it was part of our curse.\" He touched his linen-wrapped arm, grimacing faintly.\
  \ \"As if the rest of it weren't enough.\"</p> \n   <p>Isiem nodded minutely. He\
  \ knew the curse that ran through Ascaros's blood. It gave him magic, but it also\
  \ sapped his life, killing him slowly with every spell he cast. His family's curse\
  \ had already claimed his arm. In time, unchecked, it would take the rest too.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>But none of that answered the immediate question. A midnight mirror was\
  \ a planar prison, sacred to the followers of the Prince of Pain. There was no clear\
  \ reason that a Kuthite artifact should be bound to one particular bloodline, much\
  \ less a sorcerous family that had no special ties to the faith. Nor was there any\
  \ reason the Dusk Hall should want such a thing. \"What's in the mirror?\"</p> \n\
  \   <p>\"I don't know.\"</p> \n   <p>\"You should find out.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Yes.\"\
  \ Ascaros made a small, miserable huff of a laugh. \"I suppose I should. That's\
  \ what this is about, isn't it? Misanthe's death, the Dusk Hall sending us out here...\
  \ probably the Over-Diocesan's hospitality, too. It's all about whatever is in that\
  \ mirror.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Whoever.\" Isiem walked toward it and held his right hand\
  \ up facing the glass. The whispering voices went silent as he approached, and the\
  \ ghostly mist within the mirror swirled away, leaving a blank opacity facing him.\
  \ \"You don't have any idea?\"</p> \n   <p>\"None.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Then you must\
  \ go in. Or let whoever is in there out... but anyone powerful enough to be of interest\
  \ to the Dusk Hall will not be easily controlled or contained.\"</p> \n   <p>\"\
  We'll go in.\" Leaning on his staff, Ascaros straightened and stepped toward the\
  \ mirror. He brushed a palm over the pockets containing his spell components, as\
  \ if reassuring himself that they were all there. \"Not because of that. Because\
  \ I don't want the Over-Diocesan seeing who waits inside.\"</p> \n   <p>The mists\
  \ swirled before Ascaros. Instead of the flat, empty space that faced Isiem, a spectral\
  \ staircase appeared opposite the sorcerer. Built of ghostly, translucent bones\
  \ that recalled the construction of the cathedral, it spiraled up into an infinity\
  \ of gray.</p> \n   <p>\"It knows you,\" Isiem murmured, troubled and awed. \"Your\
  \ blood is the key.\"</p> \n   <div class=\"blurb360\">\n    <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Silence.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500-Silence_360.jpeg\" border=\"\
  0\"></a>\n    <br> Even under the best circumstances, a shae is a dangerous ally.\n\
  \   </div> \n   <p>\"Let's hope it works as easily from the other side.\" Leading\
  \ with the head of his staff, Ascaros stepped in. The mirror's glass scarcely shivered\
  \ as he passed through, and it offered no more resistance than mist.</p> \n   <p>On\
  \ the other side, Ascaros's figure receded rapidly up the stairs. He was ascending\
  \ far faster than he could ever have climbed a real staircase, as though the mirror\
  \ itself were pulling him in. At the top, a speck of blackness had appeared and\
  \ was swiftly expanding. It opened like the yawning, shadowy mouth of some enormous\
  \ lamprey, hovering hungrily in the air.</p> \n   <p>The sight of it spurred Isiem\
  \ out of his distracted trance. He plunged through the mirror, hurrying to catch\
  \ his friend.</p> \n   <p>Entering the midnight mirror was curiously simple. The\
  \ weight of Isiem's body seemed to lift from his feet. Walking felt like floating,\
  \ although he could see no change in the outward appearance of his gait. A deep\
  \ hush settled over him, and a gentle but profound chill, as if he had walked into\
  \ one of the Uskwood's sacred glens.</p> \n   <p>Zon-Kuthon's power was strong here.\
  \ Bowing his head in silent submission to his god's presence, Isiem began walking\
  \ up the staircase.</p> \n   <p>As he reached the halfway point, he saw Ascaros\
  \ vanish through the portal at its top. The toothy fringes of the portal quavered\
  \ and spiraled inward, as if the lamprey mouth were swallowing its prey. An instant\
  \ later, it pulsed and then steadied, open again.</p> \n   <p>Ready for another\
  \ meal. The thought brought a quick flicker of fear, but Isiem damped it down and\
  \ continued his climb. Under him stretched an infinite gray abyss. There seemed\
  \ to be no solid ground in this netherworld, or at least none that he could see.\
  \ Only the stairs... and wherever they led.</p> \n   <p>Far faster than he would\
  \ have believed possible, Isiem reached the apex. Just ahead, the portal waited,\
  \ its ragged edges weeping blackness around the central void. He had expected to\
  \ feel some pull into its depths, but there was none.</p> \n   <p>He went in. Electricity\
  \ prickled along the small hairs of his body; a soundless gust flattened his clothes\
  \ against him. Then the darkness parted, and Isiem found himself standing on a field\
  \ of stars.</p> \n   <p>All around him, black grass swayed under a black dome of\
  \ sky. The seed heads of the grass were white as snow, echoing the frosty stars\
  \ high above. The pale bones of horse and man, half-buried by the grass, gleamed\
  \ like pearls amidst the ebon stalks.</p> \n   <p>The vastness of the nighttime\
  \ plain was broken only by a single hut of felted horsehair, a hundred yards before\
  \ him. In front of the hut, a campfire burned, its flames oddly colorless in this\
  \ strange gray world.</p> \n   <p>Two figures sat beside the fire. One of them was\
  \ Ascaros. The other Isiem did not know. It wore a black horsehide cape in the style\
  \ of the ancient Nidalese horselords, and a featureless mask of white porcelain\
  \ covered its face. Countless silver pins studded the cape, glittering in yet another\
  \ echo of the starry sky.</p> \n   <p>\"What is this place?\" Isiem asked, walking\
  \ toward the tiny fire. As he got closer, he could see that Ascaros's face was white\
  \ and frozen, as if his friend had received some devastating news and was still\
  \ struggling to understand.</p> \n   <p>It was the other who answered. Up close,\
  \ it was apparent that their host—if host he was—was not human. Wisps of shadow\
  \ trailed around his form, constantly merging with and breaking from his body. The\
  \ mask and cape seemed to be the only points anchoring his body; other than those\
  \ form-granting garments, he was as ill-defined as a cloud of smoke. </p> \n   <p>A\
  \ shae. One of the true children of the Plane of Shadow. Isiem had read of their\
  \ kind, but never seen one before—the shadow-people had few dealings with the Dusk\
  \ Hall. </p> \n   <p>\"An illusion,\" the shae said in a voice accented with the\
  \ melodically guttural inflections of old Nidalese. \"Some is of my making. Some\
  \ is the mirror's. But none of it, since you set foot on the stairs, has been real.\"\
  </p> \n   <p>\"I thought this was a prison,\" Isiem said. He sat on a horsehide-covered\
  \ log near the fire, next to Ascaros. His friend shifted slightly to make space\
  \ for him, but did not look up. He continued to stare blankly into the smoke-gray\
  \ flames.</p> \n   <p>\"It is.\" The masked creature raised a hand and tilted it\
  \ to and fro, as if to undercut his own words. \"It was. Its nature has... changed,\
  \ somewhat, over the years. I am hardly the rebel I once was, and the mirror has,\
  \ accordingly, granted me a certain degree of comfort. Eternal torment has not proven\
  \ to be my lot after all. But the place is still unkind to look upon, in its natural\
  \ state, and so I have chosen to render it more appealing. A prison of infinity,\
  \ not walls.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Who are you?\" Isiem asked.</p> \n   <p>\"Call me Silence.\"\
  \ The porcelain mask was incapable of showing expression, but the voice behind it\
  \ was rich with amusement. \"My captor was fond of shouting that word at me, so\
  \ I took it as a name.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Your captor?\"</p> \n   <p>Ascaros stirred.\
  \ \"Mesandroth,\" he said. \"My ancestor. Founder of my line.\"</p> \n   <p>\"A\
  \ wizard of enormous power. One obsessed with immortality.\" The shae shrugged.\
  \ The silver pins threaded into his black cape gleamed in the cool gray firelight.\
  \ \"Whether he found it, I could not say. His offspring proved to be sorcerers,\
  \ imbued with the magic and death in his blood. He himself was not. He had no insight\
  \ into their magic and no interest in their lesser gifts. So he captured a sorcerer—\
  me—and tasked me with teaching his children. He imprisoned me in here, because although\
  \ the shaes are long-lived, we do die eventually. Mesandroth intended that I should\
  \ live forever, serving his line. So he told me. Then he left.\"</p> \n   <p>\"\
  And you've been in here ever since, teaching every sorcerer in the line,\" Ascaros\
  \ said.</p> \n   <p>\"Not every one,\" Silence corrected him. \"In the early days,\
  \ there were too many. Mesandroth had hopes that one of his sons or daughters might\
  \ become a worthy apprentice. Not an heir—he had no intention of dying—but someone\
  \ who might stand at his side. He had many, many children. Far too many for me to\
  \ tutor.</p> \n   <p>\"For centuries, I was a... prize.\" A wry note crept into\
  \ the shae's voice, and under it a hint of age-old pain and anger. \"They fought\
  \ over me, his children. Dozens killed each other. The victors sought to learn my\
  \ secrets. Some of them were kind, others cruel, but all wanted the same thing.\
  \ Magic. I gave it to them, for I had no choice. And when each one died, I rejoiced,\
  \ and added a pin to my cape.\"</p> \n   <p>\"I'm the last of them,\" Ascaros said\
  \ softly. He looked at Isiem. \"The last with any gift for sorcery, anyway. My death\
  \ wins his freedom. Silence has been engineering the destruction of Mesandroth's\
  \ descendants for thousands of years... and I'm the last one.\"</p> \n   <p>\"Yes.\"\
  \ The shae laughed quietly. \"It troubles him, knowing that. As well it should.\
  \ When he is dead, the terms of my bondage will be complete, and I will finally\
  \ be free.\"</p> \n   <p>\"You just told him that?\" Isiem asked.</p> \n   <p>\"\
  I always tell them. I give them all the same choice.\" Silence stood, turning his\
  \ back on them. He raised his hands to the illusory sky. \"I am bound to serve,\
  \ but I do not do so gladly. Walk away—release me from your part in your forefather's\
  \ sin—and I will have no opportunity to hurt you. But take this poisoned gift, and\
  \ I will do my utmost to destroy you.\"</p> \n   <p>The shae let his hands fall,\
  \ but kept his back to the shadowcallers. \"Every time a new would-be master enters\
  \ the mirror, I repeat the same offer. I have done this hundreds of times over the\
  \ centuries. In all that time, two have refused Mesandroth's gift. Two. The others\
  \ have all tried to evade their doom while using me. The master's children do not\
  \ give up their ambitions easily, and my knowledge is vast. The temptation is too\
  \ great.</p> \n   <p>\"Some try to beat me into submission. Some try to bribe me.\
  \ Some try to seduce. I have seen all their stratagems over the years. But I am\
  \ a creature captured and kept in a midnight mirror of Zon-Kuthon; pain holds no\
  \ fear and no surprises. There is nothing I desire more than an end to my bondage,\
  \ and bribes are meaningless in this place. The seductions I always accept. I lie\
  \ with them, and enthrall them, and ensure they will leave no mortal children who\
  \ might perpetuate my suffering.\"</p> \n   <p>\"You killed Misanthe?\" Isiem asked.</p>\
  \ \n   <p>The shae looked back at them. The eyeholes of his mask appeared to be\
  \ blank black spaces, yet Isiem had the fleeting impression that laughter twinkled\
  \ in those hollow gaps. \"I did not. I am not permitted to cause harm to Mesandroth's\
  \ blood.\"</p> \n   <p>\"But you know who did.\" That was Ascaros.</p> \n   <p>\"\
  Of course.\" Now the laughter was clearly visible, a roiling in the shae's smoky\
  \ form. \"It was her apprentice, puffed with ambition. An old story.\"</p> \n  \
  \ <p>\"But you did the puffing,\" Isiem said.</p> \n   <p>\"And taught him the shadow\
  \ garrote.\" Ascaros's voice was brittle ice.</p> \n   <p>Silence held his hands\
  \ out in wordless acknowledgement. \"And when the apprentice comes back to claim\
  \ me as his reward, he will die, because nothing prevents me from slaughtering him.\
  \ It's an absurdly simple plan. Utterly predictable. Yet it rarely fails.\"</p>\
  \ \n   <p>\"We could stop you,\" Isiem said.</p> \n   <p>\"You could,\" Silence\
  \ agreed, \"but you won't. Or rather, he won't.\" The shae pointed at Ascaros, who\
  \ was once more staring into the fire. \"No, he will do as his kind always does.\
  \ Even knowing that it will doom him, even knowing that he will die, your friend\
  \ will claim his inheritance.\"</p> \n   <p><b>Coming Next Week:</b> Accusations\
