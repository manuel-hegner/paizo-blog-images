  description\">The streets of almost every large city are rife with corruption. Greedy\
  \ merchants, cruel guards, and bloodthirsty gangs oppress the poor common folk and\
  \ those who dare to stand up against them find themselves with the dagger in the\
  \ back more often than not. That is where the vigilante comes in. With their true\
  \ identity hidden behind a secret persona, the vigilante is unafraid to take the\
  \ fight to the powerful. Of course, not all vigilantes fight for what is good and\
  \ just. Some use their secret identity to commit acts of depravity, unburdened by\
  \ guilt or consequence.</p> \n     <p>Due to release in early 2016, <em>Ultimate\
  \ Intrigue</em> includes a new base class for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: the\
  \ vigilante. By participating in this playtest, you can help us make this class\
  \ a fun, vibrant part of the game.</p> \n     <p>Starting today, you can <a href=\"\
  /pathfinderRPG/ultimateIntrigue\">download a playtest version of the vigilante right\
  \ here</a>! Create a vigilante, use it in your games, and then <a href=\"/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/pathfinder/pathfinderRPG/ultimateIntrigue\"\
  >head over the playtest forums</a> to tell us what you think. Tell us what works\
  \ with the class and what other abilities you think it should have. We need your\
  \ thoughts and ideas to refine this class and get it ready to stalk through the\
  \ shadows of game tables everywhere. We have two subforums for you to use: one for\
  \ general discussion about the class and the playtest and another specifically for\
  \ feedback based on actual play.</p> \n     <p>For the Pathfinder Society players,\
  \ the playtest version of this class opens as a character option. And there will\
  \ be a special Chronicle sheet available soon that allows you to gain benefits that\
  \ increase in future utility the more sessions that you play a vigilante for the\
  \ playtest, or GM a game with at least one vigilante player at the table.</p> \n\
  \     <p>This playtest will remain open until <b>Thursday, July 20, 2015</b>. Although\
  \ the forum discussions will close as that time, we'll be setting up a “Final Thoughts”\
  \ thread. That thread will remain open until August 17, 2015 and you can post in\
  \ that thread once with your final comments and feedback from the playtest. As always,\
  \ we ask that you check for an existing thread that covers your topic before starting\
  \ a new one. Remember that we are all here to make a better vigilante, so please\
  \ be polite and civil to your fellow playtesters and community members.</p> \n \
  \    <p>We are truly excited to see your thoughts and feedback on the vigilante.\
  \ It's a class unlike any other that we've ever done and we hope it will make for\
  \ an exciting addition to your game. See you on the boards!</p> \n     <p>Jason\
