  ><em>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: Core Set</em></a>. Now we're going to tackle\
  \ another important design principle: <strong>injecting more drama into the game</strong>.\
  \ One of our biggest tools to do that is embracing the vagaries of chance. The game\
  \ comes with dice for a reason, and we wanted to change how we use them and give\
  \ you even more ways to set yourself up for great payoff or greater disaster.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>An early principle of <em>Core</em> design was establishing that uncertain\
  \ outcomes are a lot more interesting than certain outcomes. We attempted to inject\
  \ more chaos into the system in a few key ways. <em>Core</em> players have many\
  \ ways to empower their characters and encounter exciting challenges, and there\
  \ is almost always a chance that occasionally the dice will backstab them (or foot-stab\
  \ them, in the case of the d4). We wanted more tools for <em>managing</em> chance,\
  \ and fewer tools for <em>removing</em> it, extending the \"lean into the fun\"\
  \ approach.</p> \n     <p>Now, that doesn't always mean increasing the <em>number</em>\
  \ of dice. More dice isn't always more chance, because you can add <em>certainty</em>\
  \ when you add more dice. One of the big lessons that we learned from the first\
  \ several Adventure Paths is that, as characters grow over time, it's possible (in\
  \ fact, pretty common) for players to choose feats and options that accumulate large\
  \ bonuses to rolls. The more you can add a scaling bonus, like from a mythic path,\
  \ marksman's bow, or cohort, the less the dice matter. Often, especially in large\
  \ groups, players could find themselves attempting checks with a static bonus so\
  \ high that they could not actually fail the roll. This was one of the reasons we\
  \ removed the ability for all the characters to play blessings on a single check.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>While there's a lot of fun to be had in coming together as a team to\
  \ demolish a check, this is one of those cases where we as designers might be giving\
  \ out \"too much candy\"â€”robbing those critical moments of tension and excitement.\
  \ With this in mind, we've adjusted our design philosophy a bit, so that we're more\
  \ often adding dice in areas where we might have previously added static +1s or\
  \ +4s. We want Harsk, Lem, Seelah, and Valeros adding a d6 or d8 to your roll, not\
  \ a d4+1 or d4+2. More variance leads to more suspense leads to more excitement\
  \ leads to more fun.</p> \n     <p>Core avoids automatic success in most aspects\
  \ of the game, especially against banes. Automatically succeeding on a combat check\
  \ against the villain can be fun occasionally, but it's mostly bad for the game.\
  \ Not needing to roll recovery checks for Seoni's spells? Sure, that's a pure quality\
  \ of life improvement that sets Sorcerers apart from other casters like Ezren and\
  \ Kyra.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6040-IroranDedicant.jpg\"\

  \ \n     </div> \n     <p>Sajan loves throwing blessings on his checks, recharging\
  \ any blessing he plays on himself. Or 2 or 3 blessings, if it's an Acrobatics check,\
  \ combat check, or even an Acrobatics combat check. He also gets some interesting\
  \ power feats for manipulating the dice he rolls, letting him really strive towards\
  \ self-perfection. If he's not using a weapon, he can add a couple of extra dice.\
  \ That said, Sajan also gets to add a card's level to his unarmed attacks. Many\
  \ higher-level weapons grant static modifiers, and Sajan shouldn't fall behind there.</p>\

  \ \n     <p>When redesigning Harsk for Core, we really wanted to hew more closely\
  \ to his RPG story. <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5la3q?Meet-the-Iconics-Harsk\"\
  >Harsk's origin story</a> involves him getting revenge for his brother's death using\
  \ crossbows and axes against Giants. So, bonus dice for axes and crossbows, and\
  \ against Giants. And his Ranger assist power lets him assist anyone (including\
  \ himself) anywhere for another die. That d4 becomes a d6 instead of becoming a\
  \ d4+1, though.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderACG/PZO6041-FrostLongspear.jpg\"\

  \ \n     </div> \n     <p>The Frost Longspear shows why only some weapons grant\
  \ static modifiers. Energy weapons, in general, are following the RPG's lead in\
  \ adding extra dice, and also allowing you to choose to turn off that extra die\
  \ when needed. For those of you worried that a focus on more dice instead of static\
  \ bonuses will make the game too unpredictable for you (some of us try to avoid\
  \ rolling important rolls if we don't have at least an 80% chance of success, and\
  \ what do you mean you haven't calculated the odds?), there are plenty of ways to\
  \ reroll in the system, like the new design for shields, or the <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgm4?Core-Principles-Rewarding-Heroism-in-the\"\
  >previously mentioned hero points</a>. And if you're unlucky enough to fail after\
  \ rerolling (Hi, Gaby!), <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgl5?Core-Principles-Encouraging-Teamwork-in-the\"\
  >your friends might be able to avenge you</a>.</p> \n     <p>Healing is also more\
  \ \"consistently random\" (in game design, that's definitely a thing!). Time and\
  \ time again, we've experienced regret due to targeted healing taking away the fun\
  \ and uncertainty of what card is coming up (and also for sometimes breaking the\
  \ game). Now, the new heal rule always heals random cards from your discards.</p>\

  \ some. Maybe most. Blame Chad.</p> \n     </div> \n     <p>Sometimes we want a\
  \ story bane to cover variable options. Not all drakes breathe fire and not all\
  \ elementals are immune to it. When we need them to be fixed for a scenario, we\
  \ can declare that it is always a particular result.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"\

  \ alt=\"\"></a> \n      <p>Ruins are a very friendly place to encounter any of these\
  \ 36 story banes. Honest.</p> \n     </div> \n     <p>Sometimes you need to encounter\
  \ the danger, but there isn't just one and you don't know for sure what you're going\
  \ to encounter. For example, a scenario might tell you the danger is a random Undead\
  \ from the table. Maybe it's an Ancient Skeleton (yay!). Maybe it's a Vampire (boo!).\
  \ And don't worry if you can't yet imagine fighting a Vampire. If the result you\
  \ roll is higher than the adventure number, you just reroll.</p> \n     <p>That\
  \ Story Bane Roster can also be used when you want to generate an entirely random\
  \ story bane or story bane type for a random scenario. What's a random scenario,\
  \ you probably ask? It's a new concept introduced in <em>Core</em> and expanded\
  \ in <em>Curse</em> that lets you choose and/or randomly generate all of the requisite\
  \ details for a scenario.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurbCenter\"> \n      <img src=\"\

  \"> \n      <p>Something you hunt, not an open pit mine. They don't run very fast.</p>\
  \ \n     </div> \n     <p>For example, Core's Random Scenario 4: Chase the Quarry\
  \ steps you through a process wherein you select a location theme (Sacred, Underground,\
  \ Urban, or Wild) then get a number of locations equal to twice the number of characters\
  \ + 1 (and at least half of the locations have to have the trait for the theme you\
  \ selected).</p> \n     <p>You then choose a story bane to be your quarry that you're\
  \ chasing, a story bane to be your danger, and another stack of story banes equal\
  \ to the number of characters + 1 to be not so friendly inhabitants of the locations\
  \ you're chasing through.</p> \n     <p>Just select 3 <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo6sgds?Core-Principles-Varying-the-Challenge-in-the\"\
  >wildcards</a> to provide interesting scenario conditions and you're ready to start\
  \ your chase.</p> \n     <p>Chase the Quarry is extra-random because as you're chasing\
  \ your primary story bane from location to location, you are presented with a choice\
  \ of two random locations to continue your pursuit. Your quarry is shuffled into\
  \ the location chosen, as is another story bane that happens to be lurking in that\
  \ location. Sometimes a little mix of surprise and choice is really excellent.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>There are six random scenarios in <em>Core</em> and two more in <em>Curse</em>.\
  \ We hope to introduce more over time. We haven't done out all the math to tell\
  \ you exactly how many different scenarios you can create with these tools, but\
  \ we feel comfortable stating that with the nearly limitless options available in\
  \ these random scenarios, on top of the already healthy number of normal scenarios,\
  \ you'll be able to play your hearts out with the <a href=\"/products/btq01ws7?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Core-Set\"\
