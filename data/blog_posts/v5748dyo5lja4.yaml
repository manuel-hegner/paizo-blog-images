  ><i>This is the third installment of our strategy blog written by game historian\
  \ <a href=\"http://erzo.org/shannon/index.phtml\" target=\"_blank\">Shannon Appelcline</a>.\
  \ You can read the first installment <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lj3k\">here</a>.</i></p>\
  \ \n     <p>The cards in your character deck require a variety of different actions\
  \ to play them. To optimize the flow of your cards, you should take advantage of\
  \ these different actions to make sure you have just the right cards in your deck.</p>\
  \ \n     <h2>Reveal: The Worst of the Best</h2> \n     <p>Cards that you reveal\
  \ to play <i>seem</i> like the best thing since sliced goblin. After all, you get\
  \ their great power, then you put them right back in your hand to use again. The\
  \ problem is that they tend to be the weakest cards. Yes, a Headband of Alluring\
  \ Charisma can give Lem a +1 to every Diplomacy, Arcane, and Divine check, including\
  \ combat... but it's just a +1! Compare that to Lem's ability to continually pick\
  \ his favorite cards out of the discard pile—including Cure spells, allowing him\
  \ to quickly cycle through a lot of cards—he can do a lot better!</p> \n     <p>This\
  \ isn't to say that reveal cards are worthless. You'll often want to reveal weapons\
  \ instead of discarding them, particularly if you're fighting weak monsters or you\
  \ need to make a single weapon stretch over a few explorations. There are even some\
  \ reveal cards that are widely useful. For example, the Ring of Protection is pretty\
  \ great for staving off a variety of 1-point damage annoyances. Alternatively, some\
  \ reveals give a +2 or more to an important skill, which becomes more worthwhile.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>However, the best reveals are those that <i>also</i> have another power,\
  \ such as armor that can be revealed to prevent minor damage, but still recharged\
  \ at the end of the turn. The Magic Shield, the Elven Breastplate, and many similar\
  \ items are great examples of this.</p> \n     <p>So <i>think</i> before you hold\
  \ onto a low-power reveal-only card.</p> \n     <h2>Recharge: The Great Cycler</h2>\
  \ \n     <p>Recharge cards tend to be the next most powerful, and they're a good\
  \ compromise between reveal powers (which tend to be weak) and discard powers (which\
  \ cost you a card).</p> \n     <p>The big question with recharge cards is when to\
  \ use them. My suggestion is: <i>almost always</i>. If a recharge card could help\
  \ you on a roll, then go ahead and use it. Maybe it was necessary and maybe not,\
  \ but there's little cost to using it. The one exception is when you have a card\
  \ that can be recharged for a power or discarded for an explore. (Many allies fit\
  \ into this category.) In this case, you should probably still use the card, because\
  \ you'll eventually get the card back, and can explore then—but late in the game\
  \ you might flip this assessment, since you'll be less likely to see the card again.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>You might take it a step further and recharge cards whenever it's legal\
  \ to do so, even if it's totally unnecessary. The goal here is to get non-useful\
  \ cards out of your hand. So if you hit the last ally in a location deck, it might\
  \ be worth playing your Crown of Charisma, even if your roll is a guaranteed success.\
  \ It's also generally useful to recharge cards that affect singular skills; yes,\
  \ you might need them on the next turn, but absent foreknowledge you're just as\
  \ likely to need whatever you draw, and it's better to keep cycling to get to your\
  \ good cards.</p> \n     <p>The biggest deficit of a recharge card is that it gets\
  \ placed at the <i>bottom</i> of your deck. If you're recharging something you don't\
  \ actually want, that's fine, but if you're recharging something that's pretty great,\
  \ you may want to figure out how to get back to it sooner...</p> \n     <h2>Shuffle:\
  \ The Lost Action</h2> \n     <p>The rulebook describes a variety of card actions,\
  \ from reveal and display to bury and banish, but it doesn't tell you a lot about\
  \ one of the most important: shuffling. You'll often shuffle your deck when you\
  \ receive a major healing, such as a Cure. Some characters also have special shuffle\
  \ powers, such as Weapon Master Valeros or <i>Skull &amp; Shackles</i> Lem.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>As long as you're not purposefully trying to keep bad stuff at the bottom\
  \ of your deck, shuffling rocks because it allows you to more quickly revisit recharged\
  \ cards—cards that were good enough that you already used them! After you've put\
  \ a couple of great cards at the bottom of your deck, you might want to be cured\
  \ primarily for the shuffle ability.</p> \n     <p>So, to make your recycling strategy\
  \ that much better, think about how shuffling might enter your deck and your play.</p>\
  \ \n     <h2>Discard: The Standard Action</h2> \n     <p>Discarding is the way that\
  \ most things work in PACG. Some characters are pretty good at avoiding it, but\
  \ most characters will discard over time. Don't be afraid to do it!</p> \n     <p>You\
  \ should definitely discard blessings, and you'll frequently discard allies and\
  \ weapons. You just need to make sure that you're not discarding too much: you should\
  \ never reduce your deck below your hand size, because doing so can cause instant\
  \ death if you take a lot of damage.</p> \n     <p>However, you should start being\
  \ a bit more conservative a little earlier than that. If your character becomes\
  \ unable to discard without courting death, he's going to be crippled for play:\
  \ you won't be able to use <i>good</i> card abilities and you'll become afraid of\
  \ facing danger. So, start going lighter on the discards when your deck is only\
  \ four or five cards larger than your hand size; then you'll have four or five opportunities\
  \ to play a discard card when it's <i>really</i> important.</p> \n     <p>When a\
  \ character is a heavy discarder, be aware that he'll need regular medical attention.\
  \ This creates the discard/heal cycle, where a heavy discarder gets healed so that\
  \ he can discard again. It's every bit as good as the simpler recharge cycle; it\
  \ just requires an appropriate healing power to get it going. Ideally, a heavy discarder\
  \ should have his own heal cards, such as Father Zantus, Staff of Minor Healing,\
  \ or various healing spells. Kyra is a fine example of someone who can always take\
  \ care of herself: she tosses out blessings like crazy, then can Cure them back.\
  \ If a character can't support his own discard habit, then make sure you have a\
  \ healer in the party who keeps regular tabs on him.</p> \n     <p>When you're playing\
  \ a character with a discard/heal cycle, you should also think about what's in your\
  \ discard pile. If you make sure it contains great cards like nice blessings, strong\
  \ weapons, or exploration allies, then their healing will be that much more powerful.\
  \ So if you can, avoid discarding the random junk you pick up in the dungeons until\
  \ just <i>after</i> you heal.</p> \n     <h2>Display: The Weird Action</h2> \n \
  \    <p>Display is a relatively infrequent action in PACG, primarily used by spells\
  \ like Strength and Toxic Cloud. When you can use it, it's pretty great, because\
  \ it tends to extend an effect over the length of a turn or longer. Play display\
  \ cards when they're immediately needed or when you think someone will explore a\
  \ lot during their turn.</p> \n     <p>To better assess the value of display spells,\
  \ it's important to understand whom they can affect. Strength and Toxic Cloud offer\
  \ a good contrast: Strength gives +3 to one person for the turn, while Toxic Cloud\
  \ gives +1d6 to everyone at a location for the turn. Strength is a fine spell to\
  \ use if someone is fighting alone, but when you're doing the final fight against\
  \ the villain, and multiple characters can pitch in, Toxic Cloud is much better.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>It's also important to know what happens to a card after it's displayed.\
  \ Typically, it'll use one of the less weird card actions. Strength and Toxic Cloud\
  \ are (hopefully) recharged, but other display cards might be discarded or even\
  \ buried. This ultimate fate of a display card can tell you more about how and when\
  \ to use its action.</p> \n     <h2>Bury: The Action You Fear Too Much</h2> \n \
  \    <p>Though you should try to work through your deck quickly, that doesn't necessarily\
  \ extend to burying cards, because that takes them out of your play cycle. With\
  \ that said, don't be afraid to bury your cards. Some characters, like Father Zantus,\
  \ exist solely to be buried; sometimes Amiri will earn boons that she's happy to\
  \ bury because they're no good. Even when an armor has a reveal or recharge effect,\
  \ the bury is usually still its main purpose, so there should never be a qualm about\
  \ using that either.</p> \n     <p>The trick comes when you need to determine whether\
  \ it's worth burying something good. This most frequently comes up for Amiri, when\
  \ she wants to juice her Strength, Melee, or Constitution. Then you have to decide:\
  \ to bury or not to bury.</p> \n     <p>Sometimes you really don't want to bury\
  \ cards:</p> \n     <ul>\n      <li><i>Don't</i> bury cards if you think you'd have\
  \ a good use for them later.</li> \n      <li><i>Don't</i> bury cards if their absence\
  \ would make a big dent in a specific category of cards in your deck.</li> \n  \
  \    <li><i>Don't</i> bury cards if your total card count is too low; that's a good\
  \ way to end up dead.</li>\n     </ul> \n     <p>But sometimes you do:</p> \n  \
  \   <ul>\n      <li><i>Do</i> bury cards that you've acquired and don't really need;\
  \ it's a great use for them.</li> \n      <li><i>Do</i> bury cards if you've got\
  \ plenty of similar cards in your deck.</li> \n      <li><i>Do</i> bury cards more\
  \ aggressively late in the game; if you're not likely to get healed again, then\
  \ a card buried and a card discarded are the exact same thing.</li>\n     </ul>\
  \ \n     <h2>Banish: The Action You Maybe Fear the Right Amount</h2> \n     <p>Finally,\
  \ we come to banishment. Obviously, you want to avoid banishing your good cards\
  \ if at all possible; in fact, if you will eventually <i>need</i> to banish something\
  \ to close a location, then you should go out of your way to pick up something worthless.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>However, there's one situation when you <i>want</i> to banish: when\
  \ you have cards that specifically work when they get banished, such as Ameiko Kaijitsu\
  \ and Mayor Kendra Deverin. Either <i>use them</i> by banishing them or dump them\
  \ from your deck. But whatever you do, don't just sit on them, letting them take\
  \ up space in your hand and your deck. Yes, it's tempting to save their one-use\
  \ power for the perfect moment, but if you don't use them, they're worse than worthless.\
  \ They're deck cloggers. Get 'em out.</p> \n     <p><i>Next time:</i> Choosing location\
