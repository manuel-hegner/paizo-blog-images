  articleBody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">For the last five years, Wednesdays\
  \ have held a special place on this blog. Every Wednesday, it was our distinct pleasure\
  \ to present a new chapter of <a href=\"/pathfinder/tales/serial\">serial Pathfinder\
  \ web fiction</a>. Some stories were from authors you already knew, tied into the\
  \ latest Pathfinder novels. Others were from first-time Pathfinder authors, trying\
  \ out new characters in front of a live audienceâ€”the entire internet.</p> \n   \

  \     <br> <i>Illustrations by Eric Belisle</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>Of all the\
  \ fun that the web fiction has brought us, far and away the part I appreciate most\
  \ is the number of authors who started with web fiction, knocked it out of the park,\
  \ and went on to become beloved authors in the novel line. Some, like Chris. A.\
  \ Jackson and Liane Merciel, were already accomplished novelists, simply taking\
  \ their first crack at shared-world writing. Yet for others, like Wendy N. Wagner,\
  \ Josh Vogt, and Gary Kloster, scoring a critical hit on their web fiction led directly\
  \ to the sale of their first published novels. As an editor, there's no greater\
  \ joy than being the first to snag an author destined for great things, and I cackle\
  \ with glee at the thought of having been the midwife to those awesome authors'\
  \ first novels.</p> \n    <p>But all good things must come to an end.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>Over the last half a decade, Pathfinder has grown immensely, and Paizo with\
  \ it. This blog, once such a fragile creature that it could be taken out simply\
  \ by <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5l9vt\">removing all the keys on Wes's keyboard</a>,\
  \ is now a robust beast with more posts per week than there are days. And while\
  \ the web fiction was once one of very few outlets for folks hungry for Pathfinder\
  \ fiction, there are now dozens of novels, not to mention the Pathfinder's journals,\
  \ comics, audio dramas, and a huge backlist of free short fiction. Where once I\
  \ (and later Senior Editor Chris Carey) desperately needed the web fiction to help\
  \ us find the next great Pathfinder Tales authors, in the wake of Pathfinder Tales\
  \ teaming up with Tor/Macmillan, I've got amazing, established authors like Max\
  \ Gladstone, Sam Sykes, and Richard A. Knaak joining a roster already packed with\
  \ folks like Tim Pratt, Dave Gross, Chris Jackson, and Liane Merciel. Add in the\
  \ expense, both in time and money, of buying and illustrating free web fiction stories,\
  \ and it just doesn't make sense to continue the tradition.</p> \n    <p>The web\
  \ fiction we've already posted will continue to be available for free in perpetuity,\
  \ and I'm also hoping to complete the ePub processing of the stories very soon for\
  \ folks who prefer to read them that way. We'll also continue to post free sample\
  \ chapters of the novels as each one comes out to let you test-drive the books before\
  \ you buy.</p> \n    <p>Many thanks to all the faithful web fiction readers, and\
  \ I hope you continue to enjoy Pathfinder Tales in all its various forms!</p> \n\
