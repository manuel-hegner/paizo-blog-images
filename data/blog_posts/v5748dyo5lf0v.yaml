  ><p>Loursa moved to Draeven's side, limping, sword dragging point-first through\
  \ the dirt. \"I thought you said there'd only be a few of them!\"</p></span> \n\
  \     <p>\"I did,\" he said. \"Didn't figure every last one of them would be up\
  \ and armed at midnight, either.\"</p> \n     <p>Understanding pounded over Loursa\
  \ thicker than the falling soil. \"They knew we were coming.\"</p> \n     <p>\"\
  We did, at that.\" From the mass of ragged but uncomfortably well-armed brigands,\
  \ two figures advanced. Loursa knew instinctively that the one in the lead was the\
  \ \"Zarred\" Draeven had mentioned. Steel breastplate over leather, an axe that\
  \ looked like it had actually seen professional care, scars on top of scars... A\
  \ bandit chief if ever there was one.</p> \n     <p>The other, the speaker, was\
  \ a scarlet-haired half-elf who wore his chainmail awkwardly. His sleeves shone\
  \ gold in the brigands' torchlight, and his left hand fiddled absently with a silver\
  \ pendant that dangled from his neck.</p> \n     <div class=\"blurb360\">\n    \
  \  <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500Zarred.jpg\"><img src=\"/image/content/PathfinderTales/PZO8500Zarred_360.jpeg\"\
  \ border=\"0\"></a>\n      <br>Zarred is a bandit chief if there ever was one.\n\
  \     </div> \n     <p>\"How?\" Draeven demanded. </p> \n     <p>The half-elf shrugged.\
  \ \"Message from a friend.\"</p> \n     <p>\"But—\"</p> \n     <p>\"You stupid,\
  \ Khydol?\" This from Zarred. \"Son of a bitch is stalling, is all. Let's just get\
  \ it done, yeah?\"</p> \n     <p>\"Well, I'd have liked to know why this fellow's\
  \ interfering, but I suppose it doesn't matter. Go ahead.\"</p> \n     <p>Zarred\
  \ barked. Almost a dozen bandits raised crossbows. Loursa sucked in a deep breath,\
  \ determined to at least die with dignity. Pity it had to be in this bastard's company.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>And Draeven, after a moment of muttering to himself... laughed.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>A chorus of low howls thickened the air around the condemned pair. Dirt\
  \ kicked up and fallen twigs flew, yet not a single gust touched Loursa. Triggers\
  \ clicked. A flock of bolts flew toward the pair and were just as swiftly hurled\
  \ aside by the spectral forces. None even came close.</p> \n     <p>The bowmen recoiled,\
  \ crying their dismay, but the half-elf—Khydol, Zarred had called him—advanced.\
  \ Shouting, he raised the pendant around his neck. Loursa could just make out its\
  \ three-pronged engraving, and while she knew little about magic of any sort, she\
  \ recognized a spell when she saw it.</p> \n     <p>Whatever power Khydol hoped\
  \ to invoke, however, was just as swiftly lost. Draeven raised his own hand in a\
  \ peculiar hooking gesture. The tenor of the howling changed, ever so faintly, and\
  \ the amulet tore itself from the chain around the half-elf's neck and hurtled through\
  \ the phantom gale into the foreigner's waiting grip.</p> \n     <p>Khydol gawped,\
  \ apparently having been stripped of language skills along with his pendant. Not\
  \ so for Zarred. \"Kill them!\" thundered the bandit leader.</p> \n     <p>Loursa\
  \ met the first of the attackers, blade clashing on blade. She allowed herself to\
  \ be pushed back, retreating, watching as his strikes fell into a pattern common\
  \ to the vicious but untrained. Strike, parry, step, strike, parry...</p> \n   \
  \  <p>The guard from Kelbran delivered a short, swift kick, catching the bandit's\
  \ ankle in midair with an audible crack. He'd barely begun to howl when her sword\
  \ took him in the throat.</p> \n     <p>Loursa's withdrawal had taken her away from\
  \ the man's companions, granting her an instant to catch her breath. She shot a\
  \ quick glance behind to see how her own unpleasant companion was holding up...</p>\
  \ \n     <p>She nearly choked. Draeven was staggering, reeling from blows that skittered\
  \ across his hauberk or rang from his blade. The blood of several shallow cuts ran\
  \ down his arms, dripped from between his fingers. He retreated before the enemy,\
  \ worked to parry any weapon that came too close, but otherwise seemed lost in his\
  \ own little world. The bulk of the gang was focused on him, Zarred included, and\
  \ it was nothing more than simple geometry—only a few could reach him at any given\
  \ time—that kept Draeven from being overwhelmed.</p> \n     <p>Another brigand,\
  \ an ape of a man whose face was all beard and rotten teeth, demanded Loursa's undivided\
  \ attention with his falling mace. His first blow numbed her arm from knuckles to\
  \ elbow, nearly knocking the sword from her hand. A third attacker appeared from\
  \ around the mace-wielder, jabbing with a spear. Loursa spun aside, dropped an arm\
  \ over the shaft and twisted. The weapon flew from the bandit's grip, but by then\
  \ the big guy was closing again, mace blotting out the sun...</p> \n     <p>An unearthly\
  \ screech, high-pitched and keening, echoed over the village. Loursa was startled\
  \ enough, but her foes seemed shocked into near paralysis; she disemboweled the\
  \ nearer of the two bandits with a quick swipe before turning to see what had just\
  \ occurred.</p> \n     <p>Draeven hung in the air a dozen feet above his opponents,\
  \ slowly rotating in a phantom whirlwind Loursa could sense but not see or hear.\
  \ His jaw gaped, distended almost to the point of breaking, yet the scream—only\
  \ now beginning to fade—was not in his voice and seemed to come from around him\
  \ as much as from within. Blood slid from his blade, painting an abstract pattern\
  \ of spatters on the upturned faces of his foes.</p> \n     <p>Without warning,\
  \ he dropped back into the bandits' midst, a blur of flashing steel and fists. As\
  \ Loursa had witnessed back in Kelbran, ghostly arms seemed to guide Draeven's blade,\
  \ driving it into organs. No matter the ferocity of the enemy that confronted him,\
  \ he attacked with relentless resolve. Strokes that should have spilled his blood,\
  \ even dismembered limbs, turned aside at the last moment, repelled by invisible\
  \ forces. Brigands began to fall.</p> \n     <p>Screaming in rage—and perhaps a\
  \ touch of fear—Zarred burst from between his men, axe hurtling in an arc that might\
  \ have split a healthy bole in a single blow. Draeven crouched, spinning, so that\
  \ the heavy blade passed clear overhead. Halfway through the turn he rose, sword\
  \ outstretched.</p> \n     <p>The bandit chieftain was fast. Instead of being spitted,\
  \ Zarred yanked himself from the sword's path.</p> \n     <p>It didn't help. Draeven\
  \ thrust out his empty hand, slapping it against Zarred's chest.</p> \n     <p>Spirits\
  \ groaned. Zarred screamed. And then he... withered. The flesh of his arms and face\
  \ shrank against the bone, his eyes dulled in sudden pain; even his hair seemed\
  \ to go limp.</p> \n     <p>It wasn't lethal, whatever the foreigner had done. But\
  \ the next time Draeven's hand-and-a-half came around, it plunged clean through\
  \ Zarred's chest with no hint of resistance.</p> \n     <p>The remaining bandits\
  \ fled so quickly their own horses might have had trouble keeping up. Khydol was\
  \ gone as well, apparently having run after he'd lost his pendant.</p> \n     <p>This\
  \ time, Draeven didn't bother to pursue the survivors. Instead, after looking about\
  \ to ensure no more bandits remained, he wandered over to the nearest house, shoved\
  \ the door open, and vanished inside.</p> \n     <p>Loursa followed. She found Draeven\
  \ slumped in an old chair beside a scarred and food-stained table. He gulped deep\
  \ breaths of air—whether from physical exhaustion or because of something else,\
  \ she could not tell.</p> \n     <p>\"Why did you let them beat on you like that?\"\
  \ It wasn't the question she wanted to ask; she was working up to that one.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Draeven shrugged. \"I can hear the ghosts' thoughts in my mind, but\
  \ they don't read mine. I have to explain what I'm asking of them. Sometimes takes\
  \ longer than might be convenient.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Who the hell are <i>they</i>?\
  \ Draeven, what <i>are</i> you?\"</p> \n     <p align=\"center\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n  \
  \   <p>Marcov hadn't planned on answering the questions. He never had before, and\
  \ Loursa certainly wasn't the first to have asked. A curse was already squirming\
  \ on his tongue.</p> \n     <p>It died unborn, smothered by a low moan deep in the\
  \ recesses of his soul—a moan that only grew louder, more oppressive, the longer\
  \ he kept silent.</p> \n     <p>\"You have <i>got</i> to be kidding me!\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>The moan became a shriek, nearly knocking him from the chair. The legs\
  \ of the table began to vibrate.</p> \n     <p>\"All right, <i>all right</i>!\"\
  </p> \n     <p>He steadied himself, only to notice Loursa staring at him. She looked\
  \ as if she were trying desperately to figure out which of them had actually gone\
  \ mad.</p> \n     <p>\"Apparently,\" he growled, \"they <i>want</i> me to tell you.\
  \ No idea why, but I'm getting disgustingly used to that.</p> \n     <p>\"I was\
  \ a sellsword, and a damn good one. Did most of my work as part of a mercenary band,\
  \ led by a guy named Craddek. Real bastard, the kind whose own mother would travel\
  \ a week out of her way to avoid. But then, so were the rest of us.\"</p> \n   \
  \  <p>\"I'd never have guessed,\" Loursa said dryly.</p> \n     <p>Marcov ignored\
  \ her. \"It was back in early '08. We hit a town called... Shit, I don't remember\
  \ <i>what</i> it was called. Not sure I ever knew, come to think of it. Few miles\
  \ east of Saringallow, down in Isger. No war, no part of any contract. Just something\
  \ we did occasionally between jobs to keep the purses full and the urges sated.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>He grinned without humor as Loursa gasped and stepped back. \"Not\
  \ all that worldly, are you, ‘m'lady'? Most who earn a living with steel? Not much\
  \ different than the men we killed earlier. They're just the bad guys when it's\
  \ <i>your</i> home they're hitting.\"</p> \n     <p>A long silence, then. Marcov,\
  \ despite his fatigue, rose from the chair and began to pace. \"Things got out of\
  \ hand this time,\" he said finally. \"Peasants fought back harder than we expected.\
  \ Killed a couple of the boys before we subdued them. Craddek was <i>pissed</i>,\
  \ and the rest of us not much calmer.</p> \n     <p>\"We killed them. <i>All</i>\
  \ of them. The whole town was muddy with the mess, and when we were done, there\
  \ wasn't a man, woman, or child left breathing.\"</p> \n     <p>The color drained\
  \ from Loursa's cheeks.</p> \n     <p>\"The thing of it is,\" he continued, \"being\
  \ dead didn't keep them from being angry. Really, <i>really</i> angry.</p> \n  \
  \   <p>\"I don't know why they picked <i>me</i> out of everybody there. Maybe it\
  \ was random. Maybe I killed someone special. Hell, maybe it's 'cause I was born\
  \ in Ustalav; we've got a whole culture built on ghost stories. Damned if I know,\
  \ and they're not talking.\"</p> \n     <p>He stopped at the table, leaned on his\
  \ knuckles. \"I remember a howl, like a hurricane, and then screams... Countless\
  \ screams, echoing forever. When I woke up, Craddek and the others were long gone—\
  and I had myself a <i>new</i> band of traveling companions.</p> \n     <p>\"I haven't\
  \ lived my own life in years. They're with me constantly, Loursa. Every minute of\
  \ every day, every second of every dream. They don't speak, unless it's through\
  \ the bodies of the dead, but they're not shy about letting me know what they want\
  \ me to do. They'll help me accomplish my ‘assignments'—you've seen them manifest\
  \ their powers—but they don't <i>ever</i> take no for an answer.</p> \n     <p>\"\
  I wasn't in the River Kingdoms for you people. I was in Daggermark, trying to find\
  \ Craddek. Keep hoping that if I can find him and the others, kill them, just maybe\
  \ the damned ghosts'll be satisfied. You want to know why I showed up here? Why\
  \ I give a tarnished copper about a few towns in Touvette? Because <i>they</i> do.\
  \ Not the first time they've gotten me involved in this sort of crap, either. Guess\
  \ it reminds them of, well, them.\"</p> \n     <p>He looked up into his companion's\
  \ face, pale as the dead of whom he spoke, and wondered briefly what his own looked\
  \ like. He'd never told the story before, couldn't even begin to separate and identify\
  \ the emotions it stirred up now.</p> \n     <p>\"<i>That's</i> who I am, Loursa.\
  \ That's <i>what</i> I am. So you want to stand there looking horrified at me? Or\
  \ shall we discuss what we can do to keep any more of Touvette's peasantry from\
  \ joining the ghosts themselves?\"</p> \n     <p align=\"center\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n \
  \    <p>\"I'm terribly sorry, Master... what did you say your name was?\"</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"Oh, you got me,\" Marcov said. \"I deliberately didn't mention it earlier,\
  \ but you've tripped me up with your clever ruse. How <i>did</i> I let you outsmart\
  \ me like that?\"</p> \n     <p>The priest's scowl deepened the already severe crags\
  \ of his aged face. \"Whatever. I'm afraid I haven't the slightest idea who you're—\
  \"</p> \n     <p>\"Must we? Half-elf. Goes by the name Khydol. Priest of Calistria.\"\
  </p> \n     <p>It had been easy enough to figure out that much in the aftermath\
  \ of yesterday's struggle at Alvren. Even if Zarred's corpse hadn't told them as\
  \ much, the holy symbol etched into the stolen pendant was blatant enough.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Calistria, goddess of—among other things—retribution. So yeah, made sense\
  \ that one of her priests might seek revenge on Touvette for the expulsion of the\
  \ churches, especially if he or those he cared for were among the displaced. Loursa,\
  \ given her attitudes toward religion in general, had been quick to accept that\
  \ explanation.</p> \n     <p>Marcov was less convinced. He'd known a few Calistrians,\
  \ back in his mercenary days. They could be savage when wronged, sure, but slaughtering\
  \ whole villages of peasants—that seemed a little hard, even for them. And he still\
  \ couldn't help but wonder who'd warned Khydol that he and Loursa were coming.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Conflicted and uncertain—Zarred knew only what he'd been paid to do,\
  \ not why—they'd followed the dead bandit chief's directions to Khydol's home, a\
  \ ramshackle town just across the border in Pitax. Once there, they couldn't split\
  \ up fast enough for Loursa's tastes. Marcov almost smiled at her eagerness to seek\
  \ out Khydol through the town's social gatherings, while he took the religious tack.</p>\
  \ \n     <p><i>It's almost as if my story made her dislike me or something.</i></p>\
  \ \n     <p>Now Marcov stood in a slope-roofed wooden structure built more like\
  \ a northern feast hall than a church. Still, it was a sight one would never see\
  \ in neighboring Touvette. Rows of kneeling cushions and blocks on which to sit\
  \ faced a generic shrine over which draped an array of altar cloths, each embroidered\
  \ with the symbol of a different god.</p> \n     <p>It was the town's only center\
  \ of worship. Marcov knew it, and the priest <i>knew</i> Marcov knew it.</p> \n\
  \     <p>\"There's zero chance,\" Marcov concluded, \"that you don't know a fellow\
  \ priest in a flyspeck like this one. So can we just skip all the denials?\"</p>\
  \ \n     <p>\"Yes, I know Khydol,\" the priest admitted, tone as stiff as his back.\
  \ \"We forbade him from leading prayers here. He was stirring up trouble, preaching\
  \ violence against Touvette.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Decided to do more than preach it,\
  \ holy man.\"</p> \n     <p>\"Maybe so. But I'll still—\" They both paused as a\
  \ village matron strode through the door and knelt beside the shrine. \"Still not\
  \ deliver him to a thug like you!\" the old man continued, his voice lowered.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Now Marcov <i>did</i> smile. \"Sure you will.\"</p> \n     <p>\"If you\
  \ think you can intimidate me into—\"</p> \n     <p>\"Khydol is responsible for\
  \ the destruction of half a dozen villages in Touvette, and the deaths of hundreds.\
  \ You live near the border; you must know how the General's knights respond to those\
  \ who threaten their people.\"</p> \n     <p>\"We're safe here,\" the priest insisted,\
  \ though his face had blanched. \"King Irovetti—\"</p> \n     <p>\"Irovetti,\" Marcov\
  \ interrupted, \"is desperate for people to take Pitax seriously as a kingdom, rather\
  \ than a den of thieves and beggars. If he were told that a nothing little community\
  \ like yours was harboring an enemy of Touvette, at about the same time the General's\
  \ men showed up looking for a little payback, you think he wouldn't grant them permission\
  \ to do what they want with the ‘criminals'?\"</p> \n     <p>The clergyman's jaw\
  \ sagged; his hands visibly shook.</p> \n     <p>\"Khydol dies either way, priest.\
  \ Only question is, you want everyone else here to go with him?\"</p> \n     <p\
  \ align=\"center\">∗ ∗ ∗</p> \n     <p>\"Can I help you, miss?\"</p> \n     <p>Loursa\
  \ gave a tired smile as she allowed the door to swing shut behind her. \"Hope so.\
  \ I'm looking for a man by the name of Khydol. People tell me he frequents your\
  \ establishment.\"</p> \n     <p>\"He certainly does,\" Ellithir said, her grin\
  \ equally friendly. \"Why don't you come in, and I'll see what I can tell you.\"\
