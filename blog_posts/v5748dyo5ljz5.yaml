  \ \n   <div itemprop=\"articlebody\"> \n    <p class=\"date\">Thursday, July 20,\
  \ 2017</p> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">In next week's blog, we'll preview\
  \ the <a href=\"/products/btpy9qy9\"><em>Magus Class Deck</em></a>, the first new\
  \ character deck for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game since the <a href=\"/products/btpy9qy9\"\
  ><em>Summoner Class Deck</em></a> last September. During the break, we reevaluated\
  \ what we wanted to do with the line, and came up with wild ideas like <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy9s2e\"><em>Pathfinder Tales</em></a>, <a href=\"/products/btpy9s2o\"\
  ><em>Hell's Vengeance 1</em></a> and <a href=\"/products/btpy9sjy\"><em>Hell's Vengeance\
  \ 2</em></a>, and <a href=\"/products/btpy9teh\"><em>Occult Adventures 1</em></a>\
  \ and <a href=\"/products/btpy9u08\"><em>Occult Adventures 2</em></a>.</p> \n  \
  \  <p>The other thing we wanted to do is to supplement our extant class decks, especially\
  \ the first seven (<a href=\"/products/btpy97i9\"><em>Bard</em></a>, <a href=\"\
  /products/btpy97ia\"><em>Cleric</em></a>, <a href=\"/products/btpy97ib\"><em>Fighter</em></a>,\
  \ <a href=\"/products/btpy97ic\"><em>Ranger</em></a>, <a href=\"/products/btpy97id\"\
  ><em>Rogue</em></a>, <a href=\"/products/btpy97ie\"><em>Sorcerer</em></a>, and <a\
  \ href=\"/products/btpy97if\"><em>Wizard</em></a>). We like those decks, but we\
  \ want to see what they'd be like if they had the benefit of some of the concepts\
  \ we've come up with since Skull &amp; Shackles.</p> \n    <p>We also wanted to\
  \ beef up some of our favorite characters. For example, Tarlin, from the <em>Cleric\
  \ Class Deck</em>, likes 2-Handed weapons, and we want to give him more of those.\
  \ In the same deck, Zarlova's Theurge role expands her Divine Attack spells power\
  \ to include Arcane Attack spells, which she could use more of.</p> \n    <div class=\"\

  ></a> \n     <p>Tarlin and Zarlova, cheering from the gallery.</p>\n    </div> \n\
  \    <p>We'd been thinking about this for a few years, and really started to talk\
  \ about it heading into PaizoCon, where we discussed the issue with some of our\
  \ fans. Turns out they'd been thinking about it too. Two of them—Tyler Beck and\
  \ David Jacobson, who did the initial design for <a href=\"/pathfinder/pathfinderSociety/pfsacg/season2b\"\
  >Season of the Goblins</a>—proposed the concept of tying some sort of upgrade pack\
  \ to reporting organized play sessions, which was the last hook we needed to greenlight\
  \ the idea. So here it is.</p> \n    <p>Starting in March 2018, we will release\
  \ four special character decks: the <em>Ultimate Combat Add-On Deck</em>, the <em>Ultimate\
  \ Magic Add-On Deck</em>, the <em>Ultimate Intrigue Add-On Deck</em>, and the <em>Ultimate\
  \ Equipment Add-On Deck</em>. We want to pack these things as full of great cards\
  \ as we can manage, so each will come with just one character specifically tied\
  \ to the cards therein. In Pathfinder Society Adventure Card Guild play, you'll\
  \ be able to use these decks with their respective characters right away, and you'll\
  \ be able to earn the ability to add them to other character decks! (I'll come back\
  \ to that in a bit.)</p> \n    <p>Each deck will contain cards of all six boon types,\
  \ but each will focus strongly in specific areas. Any character can use any of these\
  \ decks, but some will fit more naturally with certain classes than others.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><em>Ultimate Combat</em>, the March deck, is bristling with weapons,\
  \ armors, and Mount allies that any fighter or barbarian would want. Clerics, rangers,\
  \ and paladins are also going to like this deck. The iconic samurai, <a href=\"\
  /paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lc22?Meet-the-Iconics-Hayato\">Hayato</a>, will make his first\
  \ PACG appearance here, so expect to see some cards from the Dragon Empires in this\
  \ deck.</p> \n    <p><em>Ultimate Magic</em>, the April deck, is loaded with spells\
  \ and items targeted at clerics, druids, sorcerers, and wizards. Pretty much any\
  \ slinger of spells will want the bounty found herein. Included in the deck will\
  \ be a new version of the iconic arcanist, <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lg97?Meet-the-Iconics-Enora\"\
  >Enora</a>. She likes to read, so expect lots of cards that have the Book trait.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><em>Ultimate Intrigue</em>, the May deck, focuses on weapons, allies,\
  \ and items that are great for bards, rogues, and mind-bending sorcerers like Qualzar.\
  \ This deck will introduce the iconic vigilante, <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lik2?Meet-the-IconicsAric\"\
  >Aric</a>—he who is (spoilers!) known by night as <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lijc?Meet-the-IconicsThe-Red-Raven\"\
  >the Red Raven</a>. Quite frankly, we have no idea how the vigilante is going to\
  \ work yet; for all we know, he might have two character cards! Which is why he's\
  \ soloing here in this deck, because lord knows what cards he'll need.</p> \n  \
  \  <p><em>Ultimate Equipment</em>, the June deck, has lots of weapons, armors, and\
  \ items that are great for rogues, wizards, and—well, pretty much anybody. Debuting\
  \ in the deck will be the iconic ninja, <a href=\"/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lcfw?Meet-the-Iconics-Reiko\"\
  >Reiko</a>. You never know what a ninja has up her billowing sleeves.</p> \n   \
  \ <p>Because the Ultimate Add-On Decks are designed to be useful to a broader range\
  \ of characters than a typical class deck, we'll be releasing them as part of the\
  \ main <a href=\"/products/btpy8x6n?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Subscription\"\
  >Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Subscription</a> rather than the <a href=\"/products/btpy9ewj?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Class-Deck-Subscription\"\
  >Class Deck Subscription</a>.</p> \n    <p>Now, I mentioned that PFSACG players\
  \ could play the characters I named right away, but you'd have to earn the ability\
  \ to add the Ultimate Add-On Decks to your other character decks. We're going to\
  \ do a new series of unlocks in Season of Factions' Favor, which starts at Gen Con\
  \ this August. I have to keep some of the details secret for now, but by reporting\
  \ your play sessions, you'll be able to add one of the Ultimate Add-On Decks into\
  \ the class deck of another character (either a new one for you or one you've been\
  \ playing for a while). Details are still being worked out, so don't hold us to\
  \ anything just yet.</p> \n    <p>Regardless, we think you'll like it. Especially\
  \ if you're currently playing Tarlin or Zarlova.</p> \n    <p>Mike Selinker<br>\
