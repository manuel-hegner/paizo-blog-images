  \    </div> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p itemprop=\"description\">They were talking\
  \ about the dragon.</p> \n     <p>Uguro flattened himself against the rocky outcropping\
  \ and bellied closer, using his elbows to scoot along the rough ground. The rocks\
  \ bit into his bruises, but he pushed back the pain and kept quiet.</p> \n     <p>“\
  — but there are no dragons in Taldor! There haven’t been for centuries! Why, the\
  \ Dragon Plague was well over two thousand years ago, and since then our glorious\
  \ dragonslayers —” The voice was older, male, full of affronted privilege. A noble,\
  \ Uguro decided, and one unaccustomed to taking bad news.</p> \n     <p>The other\
  \ speaker was determined to make him swallow it. This voice was female, younger,\
  \ and glossed with a foreign accent that did nothing to disguise its sharp exasperation.\
  \ “Eovras, when did the Dragon Plague end?”</p> \n     <p>“3672 Absalom Reckoning,\
  \ my lady.” That was a new speaker. Younger still, and male.</p> \n     <p>Uguro\
  \ eased forward, daring to poke his head around the nearest outcropping. Now he\
  \ could see them. All three wore armor, but they could hardly have looked more different.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>The gray-haired noble had been squeezed into a gilded suit of ornate,\
  \ old-fashioned plate that had obviously been made for someone broader in the shoulder\
  \ and trimmer at the waist. He faced off against a brown-haired woman in battered\
  \ but well-maintained plate and a clean-cut younger man who appeared to be an… apprentice\
  \ knight. Squire?</p> \n     <p>The woman shook her head. “It appears the good baron’\
  s recollection was off by a bit. Would you consider the events of ‘well over two\
  \ thousand years ago’ sufficient to deter a dragon from trespassing into the barony\
  \ within the past few days?”</p> \n     <p>The young knight—Eovras—bowed his head.\
  \ “I could not say, my lady.”</p> \n     <p>“I can.” Uguro’s interjection startled\
  \ even himself. He flinched, almost losing his grip on the outcropping, as their\
  \ eyes flew up to him. The apprentice knight and the baron startled visibly. Only\
  \ the woman seemed unsurprised. Had she known he was there?</p> \n     <p>Swallowing,\
  \ Uguro climbed down the steep rock and stood before them. He straightened his tunic\
  \ uselessly, all too aware that the rough cloth was scorched and full of holes,\
  \ and that he himself was a barefoot, grubby miner’s cast-off. But he had to tell\
  \ them.</p> \n     <p>“It was a dragon. My lords. My lady. It was—it was a dragon.”\
  \ Suddenly Uguro’s eyes were full of tears, hot and glassy. His chest ached, and\
  \ it was as hard to breathe as it had been when the dragon had raked the stony earth\
  \ with fire, sucking all the air from his lungs. It was as if speaking the beast’\
  s name had brought those terrible moments back.</p> \n     <p>“It was a dragon,”\
  \ he managed to say again, and then he broke into shuddering sobs. He couldn’t stop\
  \ them. He was thirteen.</p> \n     <p>“Show us,” said the woman.</p> \n     <hr>\
  \ \n     <p>Streaks of fire had plumed across the miner’s camp, driving down with\
  \ such fury that the hard earth was furrowed at the center of each blast. Gravel-pocked\
  \ glass cracked under Uguro’s steps as he led the woman and her companions into\
  \ the ruins. They’d given him boots to protect his bare feet, but he could still\
  \ feel the echoes of fire through the thin-worn soles.</p> \n     <p>The ferocious\
  \ heat had cracked rocks and melted iron tools into rippled puddles, but it had\
  \ passed so quickly that the camp garden’s turnips, sheathed by damp soil, were\
  \ perfectly sound under their crisped black tops. The woman, Cirra, pulled one up\
  \ to examine it, then carefully replanted it. As if someone might someday want to\
  \ harvest that turnip, and she wouldn’t be responsible for its waste.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>Such strange people. Caring for turnips, when…</p> \n     <p>“They died here.”\
  \ Uguro pointed, unnecessarily. The dining hall, once the camp’s largest building,\
  \ was a smoking ruin. Outside its blackened doorframe, the miners’ boots were still\
  \ lined up in a neat, untouched row. The dragon had made them take off their shoes\
  \ before it had herded them inside. Its idea of a joke, demanding that the miners\
  \ show proper respect to a graveyard.</p> \n     <p>A detritus of personal letters\
  \ and charred keepsakes fluttered around the boots like fallen leaves. The dragon\
  \ had taken those, too. Had read the letters aloud, one by one, mocking the misspellings\
  \ and the triteness of the sentiments before it torched mementoes and owners alike.\
  \ Uguro had watched from afar, hidden, struck breathless by the creature’s cruelty\
  \ as much as by its grandeur.</p> \n     <p>He didn’t tell the strangers this. But\
  \ he saw the woman stoop to pick up a letter, and saw her mouth harden as she studied\
  \ it, and he knew that she knew what the dragon had done.</p> \n     <p>She folded\
  \ the letter up and tucked it respectfully into an empty boot.</p> \n     <p>Such\
  \ strange people.</p> \n     <p>“What do you think?” Eovras asked the woman.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>“I don’t know,” Cirra admitted. “The intensity of the firestrikes, the\
  \ size of the claw prints… I’m not saying this is Daralathyxl’s work, but —”</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Eovras’s eyes widened. “You really think —”</p> \n     <p>“No, but only\
  \ because I don’t think the Sixth King of the Mountains would bother with a mining\
  \ camp in some Taldan backwater.” Cirra caught Uguro looking at them and shrugged\
  \ apologetically. “No insult meant.”</p> \n     <p>Uguro couldn’t imagine why he\
  \ should be insulted. The mining camp was a backwater. And he didn’t understand\
  \ the attack either. “Why would a dragon come to us?”</p> \n     <p>“I don’t —”\
  \ Cirra began, but a cry from the baron’s tents interrupted her answer.</p> \n \
  \    <p>“Dragon!”</p> \n     <p>A moment later, it came again, carried by new voices.\
  \ Then the screams became higher and more frantic, and then they were eclipsed by\
  \ the sound of Uguro’s nightmares.</p> \n     <p>First the vast, crackling hiss\
  \ of the exhalation, then the hollow, unreal roar of the flames igniting with such\
  \ fury that the air itself seemed to writhe and burn, and then —</p> \n     <p>—\
  \ then everything else. The screams of horses and knights afire, the desperate shouts\
  \ of surviving commanders trying to restore order, the chorus of smaller fires spun\
  \ off by the initial conflagration.</p> \n     <p>Leaving the others behind, Cirra\
  \ ran toward the noise. The baron and the apprentice knight hurried after her, and\
  \ after a frantic, frozen hesitation, Uguro ran after them too. The only thing he\
  \ feared more than the dragon was the idea of facing it alone.</p> \n     <div class=\"\

  A massive red dragon spreads its wings as it unleashes fiery breath on a battlefield\
  \ of mounted knights.\"></a> \n      <p style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Illustration\
  \ by Tomasz Chistowski</p> \n     </div> \n     <p>Fire, smoke, and confusion had\
  \ seized the baron’s outriders. The lingering panic of the dragon’s presence poisoned\
  \ the air. It prickled the small hairs along Uguro’s neck and stung his nose like\
  \ acrid smoke.</p> \n     <p>Then he felt a lurching surge of terror and knew even\
  \ before he looked up that the dragon was wheeling around again.</p> \n     <p>It\
  \ was immense. Redder than rubies, redder than blood, and then abruptly black as\
  \ its wings swallowed the sun. The sight turned Uguro’s bowels to water. He didn’\
  t understand how the knights could spur themselves toward it, but somehow they did.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Cirra had found a horse somewhere. She was waving a sword and shouting\
  \ something, but Uguro couldn’t make out the words. Then he saw the dragon dive\
  \ toward her, its jaws unhinged to loose another blast of doom.</p> \n     <p>Rocks\
  \ took the flames. Somehow Cirra had dodged behind an outcropping. And now Uguro\
  \ saw what she’d done, distracting the beast so that the cooks and cobblers and\
  \ other camp civilians could take cover. They’d been directly in the dragon’s original\
  \ path and would surely have gone up in flame if she hadn’t drawn it away.</p> \n\
  \     <p>Cirra came out from around the rock, calling another challenge, but this\
  \ time the dragon didn’t take her bait. The baron had come charging at the beast,\
  \ his retinue behind him, and the dragon turned to meet them instead.</p> \n   \
  \  <p>For a moment, the baron was resplendent in his bravery. Sunlight sparked off\
  \ his ornate gilt armor. The knights’ thundering charge looked like a storybook\
  \ illustration, all plumes and banners and white horses.</p> \n     <p>Then the\
  \ dragon exhaled.</p> \n     <p>The baron’s breastplate, glowing with magic, withstood\
  \ the inferno. Nothing else did. The knights’ armor melted like candlewax. Their\
  \ horses screamed. Their plumes and banners disappeared into ashes, and chaos swallowed\
  \ their line. And what fell from the baron’s smoking breastplate, headless and legless,\
  \ was grisly indeed.</p> \n     <p>Lazily the dragon snaked through the rubble and\
  \ plucked the baron’s breastplate from the ground. Snarling its triumph to the smoke-stained\
  \ sky, it slit the leather straps with a twist, as if it were shucking an oyster.\
  \ Then it held the broken armor high over its mouth, opened its jaws wide, and swallowed\
  \ the half-cooked morsel with a loud snap of relish.</p> \n     <p>Hidden behind\
  \ a rock, Uguro doubled over, his eyes wide in horror and the heavy wash of dragonfear.\
  \ He clapped his hands over his mouth, trying not to retch. It was a losing battle.</p>\
  \ \n     <p>Then reassurance flowed through him, strong and certain, easing his\
  \ terror. Cirra’s hand was on his shoulder. She motioned for him to stay down as\
  \ she crouched beside him, watching the dragon feast on its kills.</p> \n     <p>“\
  What—why,” Uguro stammered. “Why did this happen?”</p> \n     <p>Cirra answered\
  \ in a rough whisper. Her eyes were still tracking the dragon. “I don’t know. That\
  \ isn’t Daralathyxl. It’s big enough, but… it doesn’t have the scars. That isn’\
  t any great red I know.”</p> \n     <p>“What will you do now?”</p> \n     <p>“We\
  \ will retreat. Our first duty is to lead the survivors to safety. Then we’ll find\
  \ out who this dragon is, and why it came. When we’re properly prepared, and armed\
  \ with more than just courage, we’ll act.”</p> \n     <p>“You will?” The idea of\
  \ standing against that thing…</p> \n     <p>“We will.” Cirra glanced at him with\
  \ a hint of a smile, despite their circumstances. “If you want. If you’re ready.\
  \ But for now, our duty is to the survivors. So we’ll go. Quietly. Carefully. You\
  \ know the trails here, don’t you? Help us find our way out.”</p> \n     <p>“Yes.”\
  \ Uguro nodded. His throat was still dry, but he was glad to help. It made him feel\
  \ braver. Brave enough to imagine doing more, someday. “Yes. This way.” He swallowed.\
  \ “For now.”</p> \n     <p style=\"margin-left: 20px; font-weight: bold; line-height:\
