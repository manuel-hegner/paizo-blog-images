  \             <blockquote>\n              <p itemprop=\"description\">Iseph crept\
  \ through the empty museum, footsteps soundless on the tiled floor. All around the\
  \ android, monsters loomed—alien creatures propped up in glass-walled display cases,\
  \ their exhibits pumped full of inert gas to prevent the corpses' decay. In the\
  \ dim emergency lighting, some of them almost looked alive. But of course that wasn't\
  \ how places like this worked.</p>\n              <p>Iseph paused at the entrance\
  \ to their destination. Pulling the tube from their belt, they blew a soft puff\
  \ of dust through the doorway.</p>\n              <p>Laser lit up red, crisscrossing\
  \ the small room. Iseph made a mental map of their locations, burning them into\
  \ short-term memory even as the dust drifted to the floor and they disappeared again.</p>\n\
  \              <p>Bending low, Iseph slithered beneath the first laser, then arched\
  \ high over the second. Of course, the android's cloaking field could bend lasers\
  \ without breaking them, the same way it was currently foiling the thermal imaging\
  \ cameras, and would have beaten the visual spectrum cameras if Iseph hadn't already\
  \ hacked them to loop the footage. But Iseph had a certain level of professional\
  \ pride, and laser tripwires were novice stuff—the sort of thing you put in because\
  \ it looked impressive to clients, not because it deterred professionals. Dancing\
  \ around them was so easy it was almost insulting. But of course the museum's security\
  \ couldn't have known whom they'd be dealing with.</p>\n              <div style=\"\

  Iseph stands in a darkened museum surrounded by priceless items in glass cases.\
  \ Before him is a pedestal with a glowing crystal. He holds the case's cover in\
  \ his left hand and reaches for the crystal with his right. \"></a>\n          \
  \     <br>\n                Illustration by Alberto Dal Lago\n              </div>\n\
  \              <p>The crystal stood alone atop a display pedestal, glowing softly.\
  \ Inside its cylindrical viewing case, it balanced incongruously on a single metal\
  \ point, its lower half an elaborate setting of wires and circuitry.</p>\n     \
  \         <p>Rerouting the arcano-electric security seal on the case itself was\
  \ more of a challenge, but still too easy for someone of Iseph's skill. The android\
  \ added the appropriate relays, synched them, and popped the case free.</p>\n  \
  \            <p>With nothing left between Iseph and the crystal, the android considered\
  \ the pedestal's pressure sensor. It was a classic mechanism—the sort of thing you\
  \ saw everywhere from ancient temples to modern bank vaults—yet still remarkably\
  \ difficult to deal with. The era when you could just swap in a similarly sized\
  \ rock as you snatched away the treasure was long gone, if it had ever truly existed.</p>\n\
  \              <p>Iseph knew the right tool for the job—a specialized lifter-and-pump\
  \ mechanism that you anchored outside the pressure sensor, then attached to your\
  \ target. The pump drew up liquid from a reservoir in the anchor, inflating a sack\
  \ atop the sensor at the exact same rate as the crane arm lifted the prize free,\
  \ making sure the weight remained constant. But it was expensive, and by necessity\
  \ single-use. Iseph couldn't be expected to have one on hand.</p>\n            \
  \  <p>It was a perfectly reasonable test to fail, yet something about it stuck in\
  \ Iseph's craw. It was just so pedestrian. If—</p>\n              <p>A glint at\
  \ the crystal's base caught their eye. There—a single metal flake, its color slightly\
  \ off from its surroundings.</p>\n              <p>Iseph smiled. A magnetic proximity\
  \ alarm. Electromagnetic sensors inside the pedestal would be calibrated to the\
  \ alloy of that tag, sensing its exact composition and distance. Move it, and you'd\
  \ disrupt the invisible magnetic fields and trigger the alarm.</p>\n           \
  \   <p>And Iseph almost hadn't seen it. Here, at last, was some quality security\
  \ work. Getting past it would require time and finesse.</p>\n              <p>Iseph\
  \ snatched the crystal off its pedestal.</p>\n              <p>Alarms blared, accompanied\
  \ by the clangs of security gates slamming down across exits throughout the museum.\
  \ Iseph dropped their cloaking field, briefly considered waving to the thermal cameras,\
  \ then sprinted back through the exhibits.</p>\n              <p>Security guards\
  \ came rushing through the main entrance just as Iseph neared it—two humans, a ysoki,\
  \ and a full half-dozen humanoid security bots, all positioned between the android\
  \ and the exit. They didn't even give a warning, just opened fire with arc emitters\
  \ and pulsecasters, the air humming and crackling with electricity.</p>\n      \
  \        <p>Well, that isn't very professional. Iseph dove for shelter behind an\
  \ exhibit featuring some sort of star-nosed lizard. The android drew their own pistol\
  \ and leaned out to return fire, winging one of the humans.</p>\n              <p>It\
  \ was tempting to keep firing—to show them all just who they were dealing with.\
  \ But nine was probably too many, even for Iseph, and besides, the android had promised:\
  \ only enough combat to sell it. Which meant it was time for the hard part.</p>\n\
  \              <p>This is going to hurt. Wincing in anticipation, Iseph slipped\
  \ the crystal into an armored pouch, then stood and darted around the corner, straight\
  \ for one of the patrol bots.</p>\n              <p>The blast caught Iseph full\
  \ in the chest, sending them sprawling as electricity overloaded circuits and set\
  \ muscles twitching. Someone kicked the gun from Iseph's hand, and then the android\
  \ was staring up at a circle of angry faces and mirrored robotic lenses.</p>\n \
  \             <p>The human Iseph had shot clutched at his injured shoulder. “An\
  \ android?” he snarled. “I'd have thought one of you half-bots would be too smart\
  \ to try stealing from the Galactic Heritage Foundation.” He patted Iseph down roughly,\
  \ eyebrows rising as he pulled the crystal from its case. “The Songstone! You've\
  \ got a good eye, for a thief.”</p>\n              <p>“I'm not the thief here.”\
  \ Iseph pointed at the Songstone. “That crystal stores the psychic memories of the\
  \ Parelnesi tribes going back a thousand generations—their whole culture is in there!\
  \ It doesn't belong in a museum.”</p>\n              <p>“That's exactly why it belongs\
  \ in a museum,” the guard snapped. “That kind of history is too valuable to leave\
  \ on some backwater world. Besides, they obviously couldn't protect it.”</p>\n \
  \             <p>“No,” Iseph acknowledged with a nod. “But they could hire somebody\
  \ to get it back.”</p>\n              <p>The guard smirked. “And look how well that\
  \ went.”</p>\n              <p>Iseph matched his smile. “I don't know, I think it's\
  \ going pretty well.”</p>\n              <p>The ysoki guard wrinkled her snout.\
  \ “How do you figure?”</p>\n              <p>As if on cue, the six security bots\
  \ swiveled in unison, pointing their weapons at the guards.</p>\n              <p>Over\
  \ the museum's intercom, a familiar voice said, “Weapons down, please.”</p>\n  \
  \            <p>“What?” The lead guard gaped, pistol hanging loose as he stared\
  \ down the barrels of his robots' arc emitters.</p>\n              <p>“You didn't\
  \ really think I tripped your alarm by accident, did you?” Iseph stood, shaking\
  \ out the last pins and needles of the stun bolt. The android reached out and plucked\
  \ the crystal from the guard's grip. “I just needed to lure you all away from the\
  \ security station long enough for the others to get in there and work their magic.”\
  </p>\n              <p>The intercom clicked on once more, ringing with Raia's smooth\
  \ tones.</p>\n              <p>“The museum is now closed,” she announced. “All jewel\
  \ thieves, please proceed to the nearest exit...”</p>\n              <div style=\"\
