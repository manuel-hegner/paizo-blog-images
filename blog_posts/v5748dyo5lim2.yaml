  \ Words</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, March 24, 2016</p> \n   <div itemprop=\"\
  articlebody\"> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">As a GM, one of the things I love\
  \ about the <a href=\"/pathfinderRPG\">Pathfinder Roleplaying Game</a> is that it\
  \ allows you to play out any story you can imagine in the fantasy world within.\
  \ But when those stories have fewer physical combats and more scheming, infiltration,\
  \ persuasion, and other types of intrigue, the rules don't have your back as solidly\
  \ as they do for combat, so a GM, like me, who ran lots of those plots had to do\
  \ a lot of improvisation. In <a href=\"/products/btpy9j6p\"><em>Ultimate Intrigue</em></a>,\
  \ we present both subsystems and advice for players and GMs alike to sink their\
  \ teeth into an intrigue game and all sorts of fun challenges they might find therein.</p>\

  \     <br> Looks like Kess is about to put somebody... on ice!\n     <br> <i>Illustration\
  \ by Nicholas Gregory</i>\n    </div> \n    <p>First up, we have two influence systems,\
  \ one for gaining influence with particular characters at an event to pursue a goal,\
  \ and another for gaining influence and power within an organization. Next, the\
  \ Heists section shows you how to build and play a fun heist and get started with\
  \ some \"Ocean's Elven\" style action. The leadership section shows how to modify\
  \ leadership for a variety of types of leader or follower that break the standard\
  \ assumptions and how to tie leadership into all the other subsystems, as well as\
  \ presenting an enormous chart of potential monster cohorts from all five Bestiaries,\
  \ with some adjusted cohort levels that reflect either disruptive abilities or relative\
  \ lack of options in an intrigue game (for instance, stone giant is much lower now,\
  \ but the hound archon with its at-will <i>greater teleport</i> is much higher).\
  \ The nemesis subsystem helps with creating and managing of various nemeses of the\
  \ PCs, including increasingly drastic options a nemesis might take once she has\
  \ fixated on the PCs as a thorn in her side. Pursuit offers a long-term version\
  \ of a chase where the whole group works together to overcome the challenges of\
  \ the terrain and catch up to an NPC, escape an NPC, or beat an NPC in a race to\
  \ a crucial site. The research subsystem helps in roleplaying the challenge of discovering\
  \ hidden lore, based on the system from <a href=\"/pathfinder/adventurePath/mummysMask\"\
  ><em>Mummy's Mask</em></a> but adding a bunch of fun twists, like monsters or traps\
  \ tied into the research progress. Spells of intrigue is an advice section on some\
  \ of the most common spells in an intrigue game and how they fit into the world\
  \ of intrigue without cracking it wide open (including their limitations, countermeasures,\
  \ and so on). This section includes advice on adjudicating charms and compulsions,\
  \ illusions and what counts as interacting, divinations, and more! </p> \n    <p>The\
  \ social conflicts section is in some ways a centerpiece for the various subsystems,\
  \ as it addresses directly how to put together a social conflict with various stakes\
  \ and contenders like you might see in <em>Game of Thrones</em> (including an example\
  \ social conflict where fey changelings are instigating a class war between the\
  \ common folk and the nobility). Verbal duels are battles of wits and words where\
  \ each duelist chooses various tactics to try to defeat their rival and impress\
  \ the crowd. For instance, the allegory tactic is a good opening tactic, but telling\
  \ a story isn't great in the middle of a fast-paced exchange, baiting tries to goad\
  \ your opponent into responding with a penalty, mockery is great if your opponent\
  \ is on the ropes with the crowd, and red herring lets you escape a tense situation\
  \ by starting a whole new argument). Lastly, the skills in conflict section provides\
  \ a variety of advice for the skills most often used against each other, like the\
  \ social skills, Perception, and Stealth, filling out some of the skill descriptions\
  \ from the <a href=\"/products/btpy88yj\"><em>Core Rulebook</em></a> with more expansive\
  \ rulings and advice. We've got advice in here for dealing with situations like:</p>\
  \ \n    <ul>\n     <li>bluffing with a party</li> \n     <li>true lies and implausible\
  \ truths</li> \n     <li>the aftermath of a bluff</li> \n     <li>bluffing someone\
  \ who has already been bluffed in a different way</li> \n     <li>requests are not\
  \ mind control</li> \n     <li>roleplaying and social skills</li> \n     <li>calling\
  \ for a cease-fire</li> \n     <li>when disguise is opposed</li> \n     <li>seeing\
  \ through an illusion that augments a disguise</li> \n     <li>two sides each attempting\
  \ to Intimidate the other</li> \n     <li>explaining negative consequences to someone\
  \ who doesn't like you without using fear tactics</li> \n     <li>active and automatic\
  \ Perception</li> \n     <li>precise and imprecise senses</li> \n     <li>cover\
  \ and concealment for Stealth</li> \n     <li>states of awareness (unaware, aware\
  \ of presence, aware of location, and observing)</li> \n     <li>hunches with Sense\
  \ Motive</li> \n     <li>Sense Motive is not mind reading</li> \n     <li>and more!</li>\n\
  \    </ul> \n    <p><a href=\"/products/btpy9j6p\"><em>Ultimate Intrigue</em></a>\
  \ is the toolkit that will let you bring all sorts of new styles of adventure to\
  \ your gaming table, or enrich your games if you were already throwing those kinds\
  \ of plotlines and adventures at your PCs. I can't wait to hear what sorts of stories\
  \ of intrigue you tell using this book!</p> \n    <p>Mark Seifter<br> <i>Designer</i></p>\
