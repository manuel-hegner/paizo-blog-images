  description\">Last week we took a look at villains of the natural world, with an\
  \ in-depth look at Nature's Scourge. This week we're headed back to civilization\
  \ to shine a light on the corruption and excesses that make villains like Nature's\
  \ Scourge want to just burn the whole thing down.</p> \n    <h2>Regal Court</h2>\
  \ \n    <p>The Regal Court is a hotbed of intrigue and schemes. The king and queen,\
  \ once young and in love, have grown bitter and distant, yielding a political situation\
  \ loosely based on the court of Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine, with\
  \ the queen locked away in a tower. With the King's supporters, the Queen's supporters,\
  \ and several other opportunistic factions, the Regal Court provides numerous opportunities\
  \ for the PCs to become embroiled in a major political conflict with no clear \"\
  good guy\" to back. As the queen says to her champion:</p> \n    <p>\"A marriage\
  \ is much like an empire, my friend. I've come to understand this intimately ever\
  \ since I spoke my own vows. In the beginning, it is full of promise, hope, and\
  \ bounty. Love is its decree. Children and prosperity are its crop. Power and vitality\
  \ are its commerce. Life is brimming with adventure and endless possibility, and\
  \ the borders of the lands seem boundless—limited only by one's ambition and ability\
  \ to grasp all within reach. And in those heady days, you think those things will\
  \ last forever, but they never do. The decrees become rote. Most of the crop has\
  \ been reaped and consumed; the last of it lies rotting in the ditch. Time takes\
  \ vitality from us all, especially those who do nothing to defend themselves against\
  \ the inevitable. The empire crumbles, and all that is left is to try to survive,\
  \ despite the parasites that have latched on and will not let go.\"</p> \n    <p>Today,\
  \ let's take a look at one of those other opportunistic players in the political\
  \ game, ostensibly loyal to the King but truly loyal only to himself. I speak, of\
  \ course, of the vizier, since what intrigue-ridden court is complete without an\
  \ evil vizier?</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <h3>Vizier</h3> \n     <p>Always lurking\
  \ in the shadows behind the throne, the vizier started serving the king just before\
  \ the queen's rebellion. The vizier is a sly and treacherous fellow, and those who\
  \ side with the queen see him as both the true power of the kingdom and the architect\
  \ behind the court's strife.</p> \n     <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Vizier <span\

  \ plays the part of the king's most loyal servant and advisor, but his true demeanor\
  \ is far more self-serving. He is slowly draining the kingdom's coffers through\
  \ the embezzlement of the treasury, manipulation of the bureaucracy, and accumulation\
  \ of a patchwork of petty titles of land that he plans to parlay into a large holding\
  \ that will one day be independent from the kingdom. His manipulation of both the\
  \ king and the prince has been masterful, and the only person who stands in his\
  \ way is the queen, who thwarts some of his schemes (even as she assists others)\
  \ and has much more power in court than anyone knows. The vizier suspects the identity\
  \ of his rival, though not the extent of her influence, and has been subtly and\
  \ carefully suggesting that the queen should be executed for the sake of the kingdom.\
  \ Thus far, the king is still loath to do so, and the vizier has begun to exert\
  \ pressure on other members of the court, such as the prince and the captain of\
  \ the guard.</p> \n    </blockquote> \n    <h2>Corrupt Guard</h2> \n    <p>The corrupt\
  \ guard serve double duty in this book due to the way they're set up as an organization.\
  \ Priding themselves on efficiency, fairness, and upholding the law, institutionally\
  \ the corrupt guards are mostly lawful neutral (technically even the Guard Captain\
  \ is lawful neutral, but only technically; you'll have to check out the book to\
  \ find out way). The corruption in the guard's leadership is subtle enough that\
  \ few rank-and-file members know about it, and they even have a paladin on staff.\
  \ What this means is that not only do you have an organization set up for adventures\
  \ full of conspiracies and corrupt law enforcement, but you also have stats you\
  \ can easily use for the regular non-corrupt guard the next time your PCs roll a\
  \ <i>flaming sphere</i> into a bar or whatever other mischief they get up to.</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>Cruel Musketeers</h2> \n    <p>The Cruel Musketeers are the only direct\
  \ tie-in between two villain organizations. Remember that queen locked away in a\
  \ tower? Turns out her personal guard, the Queen's Musketeers, didn't take that\
  \ too well. They were banished from the kingdom and are hoping for the day she calls\
  \ for them to march back in and free her. Until then, however, they've been slowly\
  \ descending into villainy just to survive adrift in foreign lands and keep up recruitment,\
  \ making them one of the more tragic villain groups in the book. The Lord Marshal\
  \ ostensibly in charge of the musketeers might be lawful neutral, but the decentralized\
  \ organization of musketeers into fellowships mean that the cruel and ruthless captains\
  \ find more recruits. Also, there's a foreign baroness trying to politically subvert\
  \ the musketeers to add a Milady de Winter style character into the mix.</p> \n\
  \    <h2>Merchant Caravan</h2> \n    <p>The Merchant Caravan are an unusual group\
  \ of villains in that very few of them can stand against combat-focused PCs for\
  \ long in a fair fight. Instead, they focus on deception, shady deals, shifty tricks,\
  \ and all sorts of scams. Bait-and-switch, shorting, smuggling, snake-oil, and confidence\
  \ games of all sorts follow in their wake. Take a look at the petty fence: \"Hey\
  \ there, need any potions or scrolls?\"</p> \n    <h2>Thieves' Guild</h2> \n   \
  \ <p>What set of civilized villains is complete without a thieves' guild? These\
  \ rogues are each specialists in particular criminal fields, including spying, safecracking,\
  \ second-story work, gathering intelligence, fixing gambling, and more. Of course,\
  \ every thieves' guild needs a wiseguy to crack a few skulls if necessary, but most\
  \ of the thieves tend to be more combat-focused than the Merchant Caravan but most\
  \ still prefer a proper heist where there's no need for a messy fight and there's\
  \ always an escape plan.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"\
