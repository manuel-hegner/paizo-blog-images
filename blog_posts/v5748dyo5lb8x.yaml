  \ #3</h1> \n   <p class=\"date\">Thursday, July 15, 2010</p> \n   <p>The start of\
  \ Gen Con 2010 is now just three weeks away, which means things are getting busy\
  \ around the office, but the big buzz is still the impending release of the <a href=\"\
  /pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8b6g\"><i>Advanced Player's Guide</i></a>, due to hit mailboxes\
  \ and games stores in early August. Each week until release, I am taking you on\
  \ a tour of this mighty sourcebook. In the past weeks we have looked at some new\
  \ race material and rules for the six new base classes. This week we are wrapping\
  \ up Chapter 2 by exploring some of the new rules content for the 11 base classes\
  \ from the <i>Core Rulebook</i>.</p> \n   <p>The biggest portion of this part of\
  \ Chapter 2 is given over to new class archetypes. These packages allow you to play\
  \ one of the classes, but with a different theme. Each archetype swaps out a number\
  \ of class features from the base class, but keeps much of its core mechanics, meaning\
  \ that you can easily have a character that is similar in concept without having\
  \ to worry about stepping all over the rules of the existing classes. For example,\
  \ let's take a close look at the court bard.</p> \n   <p>Like the standard bard,\
  \ the court bard uses the same base attack progression, Hit Dice, class skill list,\
  \ and proficiencies. The differences first appear in the court bard's bardic performance.\
  \ Instead of inspire courage, the court bard receives the following ability:</p>\
  \ \n   <blockquote> \n    <p><i>Satire (Su)</i>: A court bard can use performance\
  \ to undermine the confidence of enemies who hear it, causing them to take a –1\
  \ penalty on attack and damage rolls (minimum 1) and a –1 penalty on saves against\
  \ fear and charm effects as long as the bard continues performing. This penalty\
  \ increases by –1 at 5th level and every six levels thereafter. Satire is a language-dependent,\
  \ mind-affecting ability that uses audible components.</p> \n   </blockquote> \n\
  \   <p>Of course, that's not all the court bard gets. At 3rd level he gets mockery\
  \ instead of inspire competence. This ability causes a foe to take penalties on\
  \ all Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks as long as the bard is performing.\
  \ At 8th level, the court bard replaces dirge of doom with glorious epic, which\
  \ causes enemies to become flat-footed while the bard is performing. At 14th level,\
  \ the scandal performance replaces frightening tune. This ability mimics <i>song\
  \ of discord</i>, causing panic in the court bard's foes. There are changes to some\
  \ of the court bard's other class features as well, including the ability to change\
  \ the area of his bardic performance.</p> \n   <p>Moving beyond the bard, each class\
  \ has a host of archetypes of new class features to choose from. Clerics, for example,\
  \ can select from a host of subdomains. Each subdomain is linked to one of the domains\
  \ from the <i>Core Rulebook</i>, and taking one is the same as taking its parent\
  \ domain, except that some of the domain spells and one of the granted powers is\
  \ different. For example, let's take a look at Fate, the subdomain of Luck, and\
  \ its granted power that replaces the good fortune power.</p>\n   <p> </p>\n   <blockquote>\
  \ \n    <p><i>Tugging Strands (Su)</i>: At 8th level, you can force a creature within\
  \ line of sight to reroll any one roll that it has just made before the result of\
  \ the roll is revealed. The result of the reroll must be taken, even if it is worse\
  \ than the original roll. You can use this ability once per day at 8th level and\
  \ one additional time per day for every six levels above 8th.</p> \n   </blockquote>\
  \ \n   <p>Each class has a host of new options to play with, from dozens of new\
  \ rage powers and rogue talents, to new ways of playing wizards and rangers. There\
  \ are literally more character ideas in this book than I can summarize in a single\
  \ blog post. Just while I was flipping through, I remembered that I want to make\
  \ an urban ranger in an upcoming campaign. Instead of favored terrains, he receives\
  \ favored communities, granting him bonuses whenever he is within city limits. He\
  \ also receives trapfinding like a rogue, and the ability to push through crowds\
  \ and other difficult urban terrains.</p> \n   <p>I am also looking forward to making\
  \ a new sorcerer with one of the 10 bloodlines from the sorcerer section of the\
  \ book. Of them, Stormborn might be my favorite. At 15th level, you gain the ability\
  \ to turn into a living lightning bolt and zip around the battlefield at 10 times\
  \ your speed, damaging everyone in your path. Truth be told, I am also looking very\
  \ strongly at the Shadow bloodline, which grants an ability to create a darkness\
  \ so thick that it entangles your foes.</p> \n   <p>If you can't tell, I am very\
  \ excited about the wealth of new character options presented in this book. I am\
  \ so excited that I want to leak the entire list of archetypes that will be found\
  \ in the <i>Advanced Player's Guide</i>. Check out this spread from Chapter 2 that\
  \ lists them all.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <div align=\"center\"> <a href=\"/image/content/PathfinderRPG/PZO1115-CoreClassesSpread.jpg\"\
