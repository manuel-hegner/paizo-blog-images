  \ \n    <p class=\"date\">Friday, April 29, 2011</p> \n    <div align=\"right\"\
  >\n     <img src=\"/image/content/Logos/GenCon_180.jpeg\" align=\"right\">\n   \
  \ </div> \n    <p> For Gen Con 2011, I need a minimum of 75 volunteer GMs and I'll\
  \ keep taking volunteer GMs until the slots are filled! I also need 2 Volunteer\
  \ Assistants for the showâ€”these folks will not GM, but will instead help Liz Courts\
  \ run Pathfinder Society HQ and will be our go-to guys and gals for all things Pathfinder\
  \ Society. Below you will find the reward structure for volunteering at Gen Con\
  \ 2011. Keep in mind that you're volunteering for a slot, not a specific event.\
  \ I'll assign people to events inside the slot they've volunteered for and I won't\
  \ take requests.</p> \n    <p><b>Volunteer Tiers and Rewards</b></p> \n    <p><b>Volunteer\
  \ Assistant:</b> 2 needed, treated as a Tier 1 GM</p> \n    <p><b>Tier 1 GM Volunteers</b>\
  \ Tier 1 GM volunteers are my workhorses, everyday GMs. They are invaluable to making\
  \ the show a success! Tier 1 GMs must select and volunteer for a MINIMUM of 8 slots.\
  \ Tier 1 GMs may feel free to volunteer for more than 8 slots if they so desire.\
  \ I only have room for 32 Tier 1 GM volunteers so don't delay in volunteering for\
  \ this tier. Volunteers will be chosen on a first-come, first-served basis, though\
  \ I reserve the right to select volunteers who have previously worked for Paizo\
  \ over new volunteers. Please do not volunteer for Tier 1 if you have any doubts\
  \ that you'll be able to attend the show. Tier 1 GMs receive:</p>\n    <ul> \n \
  \    <li>A FREE 4-day Gen Con 2011 badge</li> \n     <li>A FREE 1/4 of a hotel room\
  \ in a Downtown Indianapolis hotel</li> \n     <li>A $10-per-slot voucher for Paizo.com\
  \ credit, useable at the show or anytime after, including with your subscriptions.</li>\
  \ \n     <li> A FREE autographed copy of the <a href=\"/store/v5748btpy8ies\"><i>Pathfinder\
  \ Roleplaying Game Ultimate Combat</i></a> hardcover at Gen Con</li> \n     <li>\
  \ A FREE limited edition Paizo Publishing Gen Con 2011 T-Shirt</li>\n    </ul> \n\
  \    <p></p> \n    <p><b>Tier 2 GM Volunteers</b>: While the rewards for volunteering\
  \ for this tier are smaller, the majority of my volunteers will come from Tier 2.\
  \ Tier 2 GMs must volunteer for a MINIMUM of 4 slots. Tier 2 GMs receive:</p>\n\
  \    <ul> \n     <li>A FREE 4-day Gen Con 2011 badge</li> \n     <li> A $10-per-slot\
  \ voucher for Paizo.com credit, useable at the show or anytime after, including\
  \ with your subscriptions.</li> \n     <li>A FREE limited edition Paizo Publishing\
  \ Gen Con 2011 T-Shirt</li>\n    </ul> \n    <p></p> \n    <p><b>Tier 3 GM Volunteers</b>:\
  \ This is the minimum volunteer level. Tier 3 GMs must volunteer for a MINIMUM of\
  \ 2 slots. Tier 3 GMs receive:</p>\n    <ul> \n     <li> A $10-per-slot voucher\
  \ for Paizo.com credit, useable at the show or anytime after, including subscriptions.</li>\
  \ \n     <li>A FREE limited edition Paizo Publishing Gen Con 2011 T-Shirt</li>\n\
  \    </ul> \n    <p></p> \n    <p><b>Volunteering for One Slot</b><br> While we\
  \ will gladly accept anyone who wants to run just one slot during the show, there\
  \ are no rewards for doing so other than our thanks.</p> \n    <p>When Volunteering...<br>\
  \ Please be specific about what slot you are volunteering for. I will assign folks\
  \ to scenarios on an as-needed basis, so you really only need to tell me the slot(s)\
  \ you're volunteering for (since I won't take requests). I will update the needs\
  \ in the thread below as I receive volunteers, so you may look there to remain up\
  \ to date on where we still need help. Lastly, you must have a gencon.com account\
  \ and you must include your gencon.com account # in your email or I won't be able\
  \ to get you a badge (obviously this is only for volunteers who are volunteering\
  \ for 4 or more slots).</p> \n    <blockquote> \n     <p><b>Slot 1</b>: Thursday\
  \ 8 A.M. to 1 P.M.</p> \n     <p><b>Slot 2</b>: Thursday 1 P.M. to 6 P.M.</p> \n\
  \     <p><b>Slot 3</b>: Thursday 7 P.M. to Midnight</p> \n     <p><b>Slot 4</b>:\
