  \      </div>\n             <p itemprop=\"description\">Earlier this week, Logan\
  \ gave you the skinny on Resonance and how it interacts with some iconic and all-new\
  \ magic items. If you missed out on Logan's explanation of Resonance, you might\
  \ want to take a look <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lkvl?Trinkets-and-Treasures\"\
  ><b>here</b></a> before reading on, because we're going to come back to it at the\
  \ end of the blog. You got how Resonance works? Good. Now forget about it, we're\
  \ going to talk about weapons instead.</p>\n             <h2>Potency and Properties</h2>\n\
  \             <p>Unlike items with the invested trait or ones that you activate,\
  \ weapons typically require no Resonance to use. You just pick one up and swing\
  \ (or shoot, or sling, or thrust, or throw), and the magic weapon unleashes its\
  \ punch, often with potency. Think as a weapon's potency as its \"plus\" and more.\
  \ Potency still grants an item bonus to your attack rolls with the weapon, but now\
  \ it also increases the damage dealt by an additional weapon die for each point\
  \ of potency bonus. For example, let's say you find a <em>+1 longsword</em> buried\
  \ in an otyugh's dung heap. Regardless of its current soiling, that weapon grants\
  \ not only a +1 item bonus to attack rolls, but on a successful hit it deals 2d8\
  \ + Strength modifier damage, instead of the standard 1d8 + Strength modifier. A\
  \ <em>+2 longsword</em> would instead grant a +2 item bonus to attacks and deal\
  \ 3d8 + Strength modifier damage, and so on.</p>\n             <p>Of course, potency\
  \ is only a part of the story. Magic weapons can also have properties. The maximum\
  \ potency and the number of properties a weapon can have are based on that weapon's\
  \ quality. Standard weapons can't have potency or properties, while expert-quality\
  \ weapons can have up to <em>+2 potency</em> and one property. Master-quality weapons\
  \ can have up to <em>+4 potency</em> and two properties, and legendary weapons can\
  \ be <em>+5 </em>weapons and have three properties. Sometimes, special materials\
  \ can affect the number of properties a magic weapon can possess. Since cold iron\
  \ resists magic, weapons made of cold iron have one fewer property. Conversely,\
  \ weapons made of highly magical orichalcum can have one additional property, but\
  \ because the metal is so rare and difficult to work, these weapons must be legendary.</p>\n\
  \             <p>Both potency and property are imbued within a suitable weapon by\
  \ etching magical runes upon it. Runes can be fairly easily removed or added (assuming\
  \ the quality of the weapon allows it), and can even be found etched on a <em>runestone</em>,\
  \ allowing them to be transferred separately from a weapon. Say you just found a\
  \ handful of weapon property <em>runestones</em> in your adventure. What properties\
  \ might they be? Well, let's take a look at one of the favorites of good and undead-hating\
  \ clerics.</p>\n             <blockquote>\n              <p class=\"stat-block-title\"\
  >Disrupting <span class=\"stat-block-cr\">Rune 5+</span></p>\n              <p class=\"\
  stat-block-1\"><b>Method of Use</b> etched, melee weapon</p>\n              <hr\
  \ style=\"margin: 0.5rem 0;\">\n              <p class=\"stat-block-1\">A disrupting\
  \ weapon deals extra damage to undead. Undead hit by an attack with a disrupting\
  \ weapon takes extra positive damage and additional effects on a critical hit.</p>\n\
  \              <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Type</b> standard; <b>Level</b> 5; <b>Price</b>\
  \ 150 gp</p>\n              <p class=\"stat-block-1\">The weapon deals 1d6 extra\
  \ positive damage. On a critical hit, the undead is enfeebled 1 until the end of\
  \ your next turn.</p>\n              <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Type</b> greater;\
  \ <b>Level</b> 15 (Uncommon), <b>Price</b> 6,200 gp</p>\n              <p class=\"\
  stat-block-1\">The weapon deals 2d6 extra positive damage. On a critical hit, the\
  \ undead creature must attempt a DC 32 Fortitude save with the following effects.</p>\n\
  \              <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Success</b> The target is enfeebled\
  \ 2 until the end of your next turn.</p>\n              <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  ><b>Critical Success</b> The target is enfeebled 1 until the end of your next turn.</p>\n\
  \              <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Failure</b> The target is enfeebled\
  \ 3 until the end of your next turn.</p>\n              <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  ><b>Critical Failure</b> The target is destroyed.</p>\n             </blockquote>\n\
  \             <p>The <em>disrupting</em> property comes in two varieties. The standard\
  \ disrupting property deals some positive damage and can enfeeble undead. The greater\
  \ version deals more positive damage, and can force undead to attempt a save—if\
  \ they critically fail that save, they're destroyed outright!</p>\n            \
  \ <p>Of course, other types of properties can do even more incredible things. Sometimes,\
  \ these properties can require an expenditure of resonance.</p>\n             <blockquote>\n\
  \              <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Vorpal <span class=\"stat-block-cr\"\
  >Rune 17</span></p>\n              <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Evocation, Magical</p>\n\
  \              <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Price</b> 15,000 gp</p>\n          \
  \    <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Method of Use</b> etched, melee weapon that deals\
  \ slashing damage</p>\n              <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Activation</b>\
  \ [[R]] Focus Activation; <b>Trigger</b> You roll a natural 20 and critically succeed\
  \ at a Strike with the weapon targeting a creature with at least one head.</p>\n\
  \              <hr style=\"margin: 0.5rem 0;\">\n              <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  >When you activate a <em>vorpal weapon</em>, the triggering creature must succeed\
  \ at a DC 35 Fortitude save, or it is decapitated. This kills any creature except\
  \ ones that don't require a head to live (such as constructs, oozes, and some aberrations\
  \ and undead). For creatures with multiple heads (such as ettins or hydras), this\
  \ usually kills the creature only if you sever its lasthead.</p>\n             </blockquote>\n\
  \             <p>If, like the <em>vorpal</em> property, a weapon property has an\
  \ activation, you have to spend Resonance to activate it; however, unlike worn items,\
  \ you don't have to already be attuned to a weapon to activate it. So roll those\
  \ 20s and snicker-snack your opponents for as long as you've got the resonance to\
  \ spare.</p>\n             <h2>Armor Potency and Properties</h2>\n             <p>Magic\
  \ armor also features potency and may have properties. Like weapons, armor can hold\
  \ a maximum amount of potency and properties based on its quality and special materials,\
  \ and you can add, remove, or transfer potency and properties between armor via\
  \ runes. The maximum potency and number of properties for armor is the same as for\
  \ weapons, though it's worth noting that rather than granting an additional property,\
  \ orichalcum armor instead grants a +1 circumstance bonus to initiative rolls and\
  \ automatically repairs itself over time.</p>\n             <p>Armor potency grants\
  \ an item bonus to AC (including Touch Armor Class) and to your saving throws. Magic\
  \ and high-quality armors are also easier to use. Armors of expert quality have\
  \ their armor check penalty reduced by one, while master-quality armors have their\
  \ penalty reduced by two, and legendary armor by three.</p>\n             <p>Like\
  \ other worn items, you must invest armor; that is, you have to spend resonance\
  \ to gain its magical effects. If your armor has an activated property, you must\
  \ have invested the armor before you can use that ability. Let's look at an example\
  \ of such a property.</p>\n             <blockquote>\n              <p class=\"\
  stat-block-title\">Invisibility <span class=\"stat-block-cr\">Rune 8+</span></p>\n\
  \              <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Illusion, Magical</p>\n              <p\
  \ class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Method of Use</b> etched, light armor</p>\n        \
  \      <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Activation</b> [[A]] Command Activation</p>\n\
  \              <hr style=\"margin: 0.5rem 0;\">\n              <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  >Once per day, you can whisper the command word to become invisible for 1 minute,\
  \ gaining the effects of a 2nd-level <em>invisibility</em>spell.</p>\n         \
  \     <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Type</b> standard; <b>Level</b> 8; <b>Price</b>\
  \ 500 gp</p>\n              <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Type</b> greater; <b>Level</b>\
  \ 10; <b>Price</b> 1,000 gp</p>\n              <p class=\"stat-block-1\">You can\
  \ activate the armor up to 3 times per day.</p>\n              <p class=\"stat-block-1\"\
  ><b>Craft Requirements</b> You must supply a casting of invisibility.</p>\n    \
  \         </blockquote>\n             <p>This favored property of many rangers and\
  \ rogues (and maybe a sneaky alchemist or two) allows the attuned creature to gain\
  \ the benefit of an <em>invisibility</em> spell at the cost of an action and 1 RP.\
  \ The greater version enables you to activate the armor three times a day instead\
  \ of just once.</p>\n             <p>But not all properties feature activations\
  \ or require expending Resonance beyond that spent for initial attunement. Here's\
  \ a classic example of one—<em>fortification</em>.</p>\n             <blockquote>\n\
  \              <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Fortification <span class=\"stat-block-cr\"\
  >Rune 12+</span></p>\n              <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Abjuration, Magical</p>\n\
  \              <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Method of Use</b> etched, medium or\
  \ heavy armor</p>\n              <hr style=\"margin: 0.5rem 0;\">\n            \
  \  <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Each time you're hit by a critical hit while wearing\
  \ fortification armor, attempt a flat check with the listed DC. If you succeed,\
  \ that critical hit becomes a normal hit. This property thickens the armor, increasing\
  \ its Bulk by 1.</p>\n              <p class=\"stat-block-1\"><b>Type</b> standard;\
  \ <b>Level</b> 12; <b>Price</b> 2,000 gp; <b>DC</b> 17</p>\n              <p class=\"\
  stat-block-1\"><b>Type</b> greater; <b>Level</b> 18; <b>Price</b> 24,000 gp; <b>DC</b>\
  \ 14</p>\n              <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Granting medium and heavy armor\
  \ users the possibility to transform a critical hit to a normal hit, <em>fortification</em>\
  \ provides an excellent constant effect for fighters, paladins, and more martial-focused\
  \ clerics.</p>\n             </blockquote>\n             <h2>Potions</h2>\n    \
  \         <p>Now that you know how magic weapons and armor work, let's talk a look\
  \ at something much less permanent, but often useful in a pinch—potions! While in\
  \ First Edition, potions were spells of 3rd level or lower in a bottle; we wanted\
  \ to go a slightly different route this time. Potions not only can have effects\
  \ that reach into higher levels, but they also don't need to be tied to particular\
  \ spell effects. All of that said, there are just some potions that are so iconic\
  \ and necessary, you can't mess with them too much. Who doesn't need a <em>healing\
  \ potion</em> every now and then?</p>\n             <blockquote>\n             \
  \ <p class=\"stat-block-title\">Healing Potion <span class=\"stat-block-cr\">Item\

  \       <p>The first thing you'll notice is that there are six varieties of this\
  \ point, ranging from level 1 (restoring 1d8 Hit Points) to level 16 (restoring\
  \ 9d8+20 Hit Points) You'll also notice that this potion (and all potions) has an\
  \ activation. Which, you guessed it, means you have to spend Resonance to gain its\
  \ effect.</p>\n             <p>Of course, sometimes a <em>healing potion</em> does\
  \ its best work when you're down for the punch and can't activate it yourself. No\
  \ worries. The time-honored tradition of pouring a potion down your wounded friend's\
  \ gullet is still in the game. Your companion spends an Interact basic action to\
  \ administer the potion to you, but you still need to spend Resonance to gain the\
  \ potion's effect (thankfully, you don't have to be conscious to do so).</p>\n \
  \            <p>Of course, this new flexibility for potions allows us to keep some\
  \ items that in First Edition were called elixirs (a term that in the Playtest,\
  \ we now use for alchemical concoctions). Here's one of my favorites:</p>\n    \

  >This liquid contains blood from a certain breed of dragon. For 1 hour after you\
  \ imbibe the acrid concoction, you can unleash a breath weapon used by that breed\
  \ of dragon. The potion's level and Price, as well as the amount of damage and the\
  \ DC of the saving throw, all depend on the age of the dragon whose blood you used.\
  \ This item has the trait matching the damage type of the breath weapon.</p>\n \
  \             <p class=\"stat-block-1\">You can spend another Operate Activation\
  \ action with no RP cost immediately after drinking the potion to exhale dragon\
  \ breath. At any point during the potion's duration, you can use the breath weapon\
  \ by spending 1 RP and 2 Operate Activation actions (one to inhale the necessary\
  \ air and the other to breathe out). After you use the breath weapon, you can't\
  \ do so again for 1d4 rounds.</p>\n              <p class=\"stat-block-1\">Each\

  \   <p>This one is interesting because you spend Resonance when you first drink\
  \ the potion and spew some draconic hate on your foes, and can then continue to\
  \ do so for an hour after imbibing whenever you spend actions and RP. Pick the right\
  \ kind of dragon, and you'll be the life of whatever party you join.</p>\n     \
  \        <p>Very closely related to potions are oils. Like potions, you activate\
  \ these consumable items, but you do so by applying the oil to an object or person.\
  \ While it usually takes one hand to drink or administer a potion, applying oil\
  \ takes two hands. This particular oil may be of interest to shield users.</p>\n\

  \ <em>mending</em> spell that repairs the item. If the item was broken, it is no\
  \ longer broken. If the item has Dents, it loses those Dents. This restoration doesn't\
  \ restore lost pieces. For instance, if used on a text with missing pages, it wouldn't\
