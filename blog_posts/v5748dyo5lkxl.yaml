  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p itemprop=\"description\">The past few months have been\
  \ busy for the organized play team, from many of us traveling to give fans sneak\
  \ peaks of <a href=\"/pathfinderplaytest\">the Pathfinder Playtest</a> to our developing\
  \ a huge number of scenarios to launch at PaizoCon, Origins, and Gen Con (more on\
  \ those Gen Con adventures in several upcoming preview blogs). We've also been discussing\
  \ many of the features in a Second Edition Pathfinder Society campaign, as we introduced\
  \ in our <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lklx?Pathfinder-Society-2-Expanding-on-the-FAQ\"\
  >initial playtest blog</a> as well as the <a href=\"/community/blog/v5748dyo5lko1?Pathfinder-Society-2-Replay-Rewards-and-Rebuilds\"\
  >blog that followed</a>. We'll be getting into some of our ideas—including some\
  \ possibilities for incentivizing special events without gating material—and takeaways\
  \ from your feedback shortly after Gen Con.</p> \n    <p>In the meantime, I want\
  \ to confirm and reinforce what you'll be seeing at Gen Con and beyond for the Pathfinder\
  \ Society Playtest.</p> \n    <h2>1: What to Play</h2> \n    <p>Paizo has created\
  \ 11 different adventures for you to playtest, and we're including them all in the\
  \ organized play playtest.</p> \n    <p><a href=\"/products/btpya0ag?Pathfinder-Playtest-Adventure-Doomsday-Dawn\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Playtest Adventure: Doomsday Dawn</i></a> (August 2nd): The biggest\
  \ playtest adventure resource by far is this series of 7 adventures that span a\
  \ wide range of levels. Some of these are \"traditional\" adventures, whereas others\
  \ are designed to stress-test different parts of the game. A common estimate is\
  \ that each of these adventures runs about twice the length of a Pathfinder Society\
  \ scenario, though it will vary by your group, play style, and familiarity with\
  \ the rules.</p> \n    <p><i><a href=\"/products/btpya1y3?Pathfinder-Society-Playtest-Scenario-1-The-Rose-Street-Revenge\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Playtest #1: The Rose Street Revenge&nbsp;</a></i>(August 6th):\
  \ This is a series of four quests (short adventures intended to take about 40-;60\
  \ minutes each). Explore Absalom, clash with a variety of foes, catch a murderer,\
  \ and emerge as heroes.</p> \n    <p><a href=\"/products/btpya1y4?Pathfinder-Society-Playtest-Scenario-2-Raiders-of-Shrieking-Peak\"\
  ><i>Pathfinder Society Playtest #2: Raiders of Shrieking Peak</i></a> (August 6th):\
  \ This is a scenario (about 4-;5 hours) for 5th-level characters, taking the PCs\
  \ into the Isle of Kortos's wilderness to rescue a missing comrade and recover a\
  \ lost relic.</p> \n    <p><i><a href=\"/products/btpya1y5?Pathfinder-Society-Playtest-Scenario-3-Arclords-Envy\"\
  >Pathfinder Society Playtest #3: Arclord's Envy</a></i> (August 6th): This is a\
  \ scenario for 5th-level characters that takes place in the wondrously arcane nation\
  \ Nex. Solve a murder in the capital city, where mages, golems, and elementals rule.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><i>Pathfinder Society Playtest #4: The Frozen Oath</i> (September 26th):\
  \ This is a scenario for 10th-level characters, taking the PCs into the frozen Crown\
  \ of the World. There they'll fight with all manner of arctic menaces while uncovering\
  \ an ancient ruin. We'll have a product page up for this scenario soon.</p> \n \
  \   <p>Beyond that, Paizo's also excited to receive any homebrew adventure data.\
  \ Just keep in mind that 1) that style of game doesn't earn any organized play credit\
  \ (see below) and that 2) one big advantage of having printed adventures to playtest\
  \ is that they control for more variables in the playtest process and thus provide\
  \ information that's easier to process and compare.</p> \n    <div class=\"blurb360\"\

  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20180711-Valeros_360.jpeg\"\
  ></a> \n     <p><i>Valeros is pumped and ready to playtest!</i></p>\n    </div>\
  \ \n    <h2>2: Characters</h2> \n    <p>The playtest experience is distinct from\
  \ the current Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild campaign. That means you aren't\
  \ bringing your existing Pathfinder Society characters to the table—at least not\
  \ directly. There are two different ways we're handling player characters.</p> \n\
  \    <p><b>Build Your Own Character:</b> In Pathfinder Society, you have to play\
  \ a certain number of times to reach a particular level. In order to playtest a\
  \ wide range of levels, we're not using that organic character growth model in the\
  \ playtest. Instead, each of these adventures is made for characters of a particular\
  \ level, and you get to build a character of that level and just show up.</p> \n\
  \    <p><b>Play a Pregenerated Character:</b> The organized play team is providing\
  \ a set of pregenerated characters (we're currently working on six of them with\
  \ a possible seventh character) at both 1st and 5th levels. That's perfect for Pathfinder\
  \ Playtest Scenarios #1-3, especially when running <i>The Rose Street Revenge</i>\
  \ as a demo or when playing these adventures at conventions. You can also use the\
  \ 1st-level pregenerated characters for the first <i>Doomsday Dawn</i> adventure\
  \ with some minor modifications—or your own home games, if you like.</p> \n    <p>Doesn't\
  \ that leave plenty of adventures in which there won't be a pregenerated character\
  \ option? Yes. We're providing a good array of pregens for our first few adventures,\
  \ but creating pregenerated characters for all of the levels represented isn't practical.\
  \ Paizo's also really interested to hear about the character-building process—if\
  \ it was easy, intuitive, hard in places, et cetera. This does make it important\
  \ to factor this into your playtest schedule, though (see the General Advice below).</p>\
  \ \n    <h2>3: Earning Credit</h2> \n    <p>Back in March, we introduced <a href=\"\
  /community/blog/v5748dyo5lko1?Pathfinder-Society-2-Replay-Rewards-and-Rebuilds\"\
  >a \"prize table\" method of earning playtest credit</a> (see the end of the linked\
  \ blog). The more we discussed and refined the concept, the more we liked it.</p>\
  \ \n    <p><b>Playtest Points:</b> At the back of each Pathfinder Society Playtest\
  \ scenario, you'll find a pair of half-page tracking sheets. Each asks you to record\
  \ the adventure you played, the date completed, the GM's organized play number,\
  \ the GM's initials, and a reminder to fill out that adventure's survey (see below).\
  \ That means that instead of receiving a different Chronicle sheet for each adventure,\
  \ you'll just fill in a single line of information. If you fill up your tracking\
  \ sheet, just grab a new one and starting filling it in, too. Just keep these sheets\
  \ together, much like you would your character's Chronicle sheets!</p> \n    <p>In\
  \ addition, for each of these adventures you will earn a number of Playtest Points\
  \ (PTP).&nbsp;</p> \n    <ul> \n     <li>Earn 1 PTP for each playtest quest played.\
  \ It's absolutely fine to play all of <i>The Rose Street Revenge</i> in one sitting\
  \ and record it as a single event.</li> \n     <li>Earn 4 PTP for each playtest\
  \ scenario played.</li> \n     <li>Earn 4 PTP for each chapter of <i>Doomsday Dawn</i></li>\
  \ \n     <li>For every 4 PTP someone earns by being a GM, they'll receive 1 bonus\
  \ PTP.</li> \n    </ul> \n    <div class=\"blurbCenter\">\n     <a href=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20180711-ReportingSheet.jpg\"\
  ><img src=\"//cdn.paizo.com/image/content/PathfinderSociety/20180711-ReportingSheet_500.jpeg\"\
  ></a>\n    </div> \n    <p>As we approach the launch of Pathfinder Society's Second\
  \ Edition campaign, we'll post the different ways that you can redeem these points\
  \ for special character options. These aren't intended as major power upgrades but\
  \ rather as fun tools, backgrounds, and other options to thank you for contributing\
  \ to the playtest process.</p> \n    <p><b>Replay:</b> You can freely replay these\
  \ 11 playtest adventures for credit; in fact, you'll likely learn something new\
  \ about the game each time you play an adventure. Just be sure your foreknowledge\
  \ of any story and encounters doesn't ruin the experience for others at the table.\
  \ We expect there will be plenty of playtest rewards, so by replaying some adventures\
  \ and gaining extra PTP, those points aren't going to go to waste.</p> \n    <p><b>Reporting:</b>\
  \ How are we tracking how many PTP you've earned? Although your tracking sheets\
  \ are a handy record, you'll be purchasing rewards using your accumulated PTP reported\
  \ on paizo.com. Yep, reporting is important. Think of this as a trial run for how\
  \ we can provide ongoing rewards once we launch the new campaign, so help us report\
  \ events dutifully so that we might distribute, say, ancestry boons in the future.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>But what's your character name? Your character number? Your faction?\
  \ Go ahead and make up a name used in playtesting. For your number, use <b>XXXXX-15XX</b>\
  \ (for example, 11300-1501 for a first character, 11300-1502 for the second, etc.).\
  \ It's easy to go overboard in creating characters by making loads of characters,\
  \ so you might want to stick to just a few numbers or one character number per playtest\
  \ class. Whichever strategy you choose, the playtest points you earn are cumulative\
  \ to the campaign; you don't need to assign credit to the same character.</p> \n\
  \    <h2>4: Surveys</h2> \n    <p>Surveys are going to be a major vector for soliciting\
  \ feedback during the playtest process, and that includes the organized play events.\
  \ In addition to several general-purpose surveys, each of the playtest adventures\
  \ will have associated surveys—often including a different survey for the players\
  \ and for the GM—that seek scenario-specific information. Once the playtest launches\
  \ at Gen Con on the first weekend of August, you'll be able to find these surveys\
  \ at <a href=\"/pathfinderplaytest\"><b>paizo.com/pathfinderplaytest</b></a>. Keep\
  \ in mind that Paizo will periodically add more surveys to that site to secure more\
  \ information and better pace the playtest feedback.</p> \n    <p>In particular\
  \ when running chapters of <i>Doomsday Dawn</i>, keep in mind that there might be\
  \ specific numbers to track during gameplay. If you are the GM, please take a look\
  \ at the survey beforehand so that you can record these values and report them accurately\
  \ later.</p> \n    <h2>5: General Advice</h2> \n    <p><b>Plan for Building Characters:</b>\
  \ In the Characters section above, I noted that there will only 1st- and 5th-level\
  \ pregenerated characters available. This comes with a really important consideration:\
  \ plan for building characters <b>AT or BEFORE your playtest events</b>. That might\
  \ mean gathering your group together the day before the event to run a character-building\
  \ session. It might mean scheduling the event to start an hour earlier to build\
  \ in time for this process. If someone shows up without a character for Pathfinder\
  \ Society Playtest #1, 2, or 3, they can always grab a pregenerated character. For\
  \ #4, though? It's important to have that character ready to go. Work out with your\
  \ group, your store, or your community what makes the most sense.</p> \n    <p>How\
  \ much gold does your higher-level character start with? Each PC should be built\
  \ using the character wealth numbers for their respective levels found on page 348\
  \ of the <i>Pathfinder Playtest Rulebook</i> (see Table 11-2).</p> \n    <p><b>Plan\
  \ for Teaching Rules:</b> I've now run many hours of our convention demo and the\
  \ <i>Rose Street Revenge</i> quests, and I've found it's possible to convey a nice\
  \ overview of the rules in about 10 minutes. However, I could readily stretch that\
  \ out to three times that length, especially in answering questions. As with planning\
  \ for building characters, you'll want to schedule a little time for teaching the\
  \ rules.</p> \n    <p><b>Assess Your Area's Needs:</b> Just figure out what's best\
  \ for your region, your gaming space, or your home group. It might make sense to\
  \ run a few big events, meet regularly to run part of a scenario at a time, or create\
  \ temporary playtesting groups to tackle the larger <i>Doomsday Dawn</i> adventures.\
  \ Take the time to discuss it with your community. There's no one right answer.</p>\
  \ \n    <p>We're excited to see what you think of the new edition and our excellent\
  \ new adventures! Next week we'll provide previews of the upcoming July and August\
  \ Pathfinder Society and Starfinder Society scenarios, and the following week we'll\
  \ preview the increasingly imminent Pathfinder Playtest scenarios.</p> \n    <p>John\
